What Marine Corps aviation has in store over the next five years,"NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. C Over the next five years Marine aviators should see more F-35s, an upgraded MV-22 Osprey fleet, a larger fleet of cargo aircraft and data-enabled predictive aircraft maintenance. Thats the vision Deputy Commandant for Aviation Lt. Gen. Bradford Gering shared Tuesday at the Navy Leagues annual Sea-Air-Space Exposition. ∞So, what does modernization look like in the Marine Corps? Its an all-fifth-gen tactical air force of F-35s augmented by collaborative combat aircraft,± Gering said. ∞Its a full fleet of CH-53K helicopters for the heavy lift mission.± Gering added that the MV-22 program will have finished its platform midlife upgrades over the remainder of the next five-year budget cycle. RELATED AI, advanced tech central to new Marine Corps aviation planThe Marine Corps is also planning to shift its F-35 Joint Strike Fighter procurements to buy more carrier-based F-35Cs and fewer vertical landing F-35Bs. By Stephen Losey Also involved in the Corps aviation wing will be its drone fleet of MQ-9 Reapers, which are flying today. Those will eventually see major payload and sensor upgrades, Gering said. On the larger side of the aviation equation, the Corps expects to complete purchasing of the 95 total KC-130J cargo planes it needs for its transport fleet. Two training squadrons and nine operational squadrons are now flying the F-35 Lightning II jet, a fifth-generation fighter. Over the next five years the Corps will build another seven active duty squadrons, which will be supplemented by two Reserve squadrons. At the end of the F-35 transition there will be 18 active squadrons, a dozen flying the F-35B and six flying the F-35C. The two Reserve squadrons will fly the C variant, which is built for aircraft carrier takeoff and landing. The B variant can conduct vertical takeoff and landing. Gering said the Corps also wants to be able to maintain and close kill webs and all enemy air assets through an airborne command and control and an ∞aviation ground support structure that is scalable and can conduct expeditionary operations and work in a distributed aviation environment.± In its aviation plan, released in January, the Corps provided more details on its airborne assets. The Marines shifted their F-35 plans to buy more carrier-based F-35Cs and fewer short takeoff and vertical landing F-35Bs. The total number of Joint Strike Fighters the service plans to buy remains 420. The Corps will eventually fly 280 F-35Bs and 140 F-35Cs, more than doubling the number of F-35Cs included in the 2022 plan, which called for 353 F-35Bs and 67 F-35Cs.

"F/A-XX could be the Navys last piloted fighter, bring greater range","NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. The Navys upcoming sixth-generation fighter may be its last manned fighter, the director of the services air warfare division said Tuesday. F/A-XX will include new capabilities and technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, Rear Adm. Michael Donnelly said at the Navy Leagues Sea Air Space conference. The upgrades will provide more battlespace awareness and improve how naval aviators make decisions. Those technological advancements could help bring the Navy into a new era where piloted and unmanned aircraft operate more closely together, such as with the Navys planned AI-operated drone wingmen, known as collaborative combat aircraft, or larger, unmanned platforms that might come in the future. ∞It could be our last tactical manned fighter that we operate out of the Navy,± Donnelly said. ∞It will actually be at a point where we are more man-on-the-loop than man-in-the-loop, and be the bridge to fully integrating towards the hybrid air wing [combining crewed and uncrewed platforms] in the future, in the 2040s.± Donnelly said the F/A-XX will allow the Navy to operate in contested environments and outmatch adversaries in ways that surpass the Navys current fighters. ∞We do that today, but we do it at parity because of the capabilities we have fielded today,± Donnelly said. ∞So F/A-XX is going to be that next improvement.± Navy officials would not say when an announcement on F/A-XX would be made, but it could come soon. The Air Forces counterpart to the Navys F/A-XX the Boeing-made F-47 Next Generation Air Dominance fighter was announced by President Donald Trump in an Oval Office event March 21. Breaking Defense reported last month that Lockheed Martin had been eliminated from the running for F/A-XX, leaving Boeing and Northrop Grumman as the remaining competitors. At the Sea Air Space event, Donnelly told reporters that F/A-XX is expected to be able to fly more than 25% farther than Navys current fighters before having to top up with a refueling tanker. The F/A-18 Super Hornet has a combat range of about 1,275 nautical miles, and the carrier-based F-35C Joint Strike Fighter can fly more than 1,200 nautical miles. ∞Thats a core attribute of the F/A-XX,± Donnelly told reporters. ∞It will definitely have longer inherent range, and then with refueling, you could say thats indefinite, as long as refueling is available.± About Stephen Losey Stephen Losey is the air warfare reporter for Defense News.

US sends F-35s to Middle East as strikes on Houthis continue,"The U.S. military has deployed more of its most advanced fighter jets to the Middle East as it continues to strike Yemens Houthi rebels, an Iran-backed terrorist group attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea, according to multiple congressional aides. The fifth-generation F-35A is the Air Forces premier fighter, which includes stealth capabilities and advanced sensors and can carry a variety of air-to-air and air-to-ground guided weaponry. The Pentagon previously surged the fighters to the Middle East amid the conflict in Gaza, while trying to contain a full regional war. While there, the fighters conducted airstrikes against the Houthis during the Biden administrations campaign to reopen shipping lanes. RELATED How Trumps team flipped on bombing the Houthis∞Whether were going to make the Houthis cry for mercy anytime soon is extremely unlikely,± one expert on Yemen said. By Noah Robertson More than two weeks into the Trump administrations intensified airstrike campaign in Yemen, Hegseth has rushed further military assets to U.S. Central Command. Hes extended the deployment of the Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group in the Red Sea and announced the carrier Carl Vinson and its strike group would soon join it. The Pentagon has also sent multiple A-10 Warthogs to the region and at least six B-2 stealth bombers to Navy Support Facility Diego Garcia, a U.S. base in the Indian Ocean. That means that roughly half of the Air Forces B-2 fleet that is able to carry out missions is now deployed to Diego Garcia. The Air Force has 20 total B-2 Spirits, but only about 55% of them were mission-capable in 2024, according to service statistics. At the same time, the U.S. has redirected multiple scarce air defense systems from South Korea to the Middle East, including two Patriot batteries and one Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, battery. ∞Secretary Hegseth continues to make clear that, should Iran or its proxies threaten American personnel and interests in the region, the United States will take decisive action to defend our people,± Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement Tuesday evening. The posture changes send a clear signal to Iran, the Houthis main backer and Americas top adversary in the region. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened Tehran in recent weeks to cut its support for the group or risk American retaliation. ∞The choice for the Houthis is clear: Stop shooting at U.S. ships, and we will stop shooting at you. Otherwise, we have only just begun, and the real pain is yet to come, for both the Houthis and their sponsors in Iran,± Trump posted on his Truth Social app on Monday. The Houthis have been one of the most resilient parts of Irans regional proxy network, badly damaged after attacks from Israel over the last year. Shortly after Israels war in Gaza began in the fall of 2023, the group began targeting commercial ships transiting the Red Sea with missiles and aerial drones. The Houthis continued those attacks despite repeated American strikes and a U.S.-led coalition launched to protect global maritime trade, which eventually rerouted elsewhere. Still, despite two weeks of renewed U.S. strikes on Houthi sites across Yemen hitting over 100 command posts, stockpiles, launch sites and even leaders the group has not backed down and commercial shipping companies have not returned to the Red Sea. Editors note: After publication of this story, an Air Force official called to inform Defense News that the country previously said to be hosting the fighters was incorrect.

Italy looks to fighter friend Japan for a new maritime-patrol plane,"ROME Italy is considering buying the Japanese Kawasaki P-1 maritime patrol aircraft to tackle hostile submarines in the Mediterranean, a move which would break an Italian tradition of U.S. aircraft purchases and strengthen ties with Tokyo. ∞The P-1 is is one of the possible options available,± Italian Air Force chief Luca Goretti told reporters on Friday when asked how Italy aimed to fill gaps in its maritime patrol capability. ∞We have a great relationship with Japan,± he added. A four engine platform designed from scratch as a maritime patrol aircraft, the P-1 has been in service in Japan since 2013. While export efforts to date have not been successful, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force now operates 33 aircraft. As Italy retired the last of its long serving Atlantique maritime patrol planes in 2017 it acquired ATR 72‰s jointly built by Airbus and local firm Leonardo to fill the role, operated by mixed Air Force and Navy crews. But while offering electronically scanned radar, the aircraft lacked anti-submarine warfare capabilities and were only considered a gap filler. A new purchase to fill that gap would coincide with renewed naval activity in the Mediterranean by friendly and hostile powers. Acquiring the P-1 instead of the US P-8 aircraft would follow years in which Italy has looked to the U.S. for imported aircraft including B767 tankers, C-130s, Gulfstream sensor aircraft, F-35s and Reaper drones. Italy has recently boosted ties with Japan as the two countries team with the U.K. on the GCAP sixth-generation fighter program. In 2023, Leonardo also pitched its M-346 jet trainer to Japan to replace Tokyos Kawasaki T-4 trainers after Japanese pilots were dispatched to train on the M-346 in Italy. In an address to the Italian parliament about the GCAP program on March 13, Air Force chief Goretti said working with Japan on the sixth-generation jet was prompting discussion about other possible team-ups. ∞Right now there is an Italian delegation in Japan because there are other chances for growth with (Japan) including the development of a trainer for them as well as a joint patrol aircraft,± he said. ∞Our collaboration has opened other horizons which were unthinkable until very recently,± he added. Gorettis suggestion of an Italian jet trainer deal with Japan and a Japanese patrol aircraft deal with Italy hinted at a possible trade-off which recalls how Italy sold the M-346 to Israel in 2012 in return for buying Israeli sensor-laden Gulfstreams and an Israeli surveillance satellite.

"Denmark signals plan to join European air refueling pool, buy tankers","PARIS Denmark indicated plans to join a European pool of air-to-air refueling tankers, including the potential purchase of two Airbus A330 MRTT refueling aircraft, with Danish participation in the joint capacity estimated to cost about 7.4 billion Danish kroner ($1.1 billion) over the 2025-2033 period. Danish Chief of Defence Gen. Michael Hyldgaard has recommended Denmark become a partner in the six-nation Multinational Multi-Role Tanker Transport Fleet, initially through the purchase of flight hours for air refueling, followed by negotiations to buy a share in the pool equivalent to two refueling aircraft, the Ministry of Defence said on March 25. Aerial refueling is one of several critical defense enablers where Europe partly relies on U.S. capacities, a dependency that appears increasingly risky as the American government disengages from Europe. The stakes may be even higher for Denmark, as U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to annex Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory. The Danish air force operates F-16 and F-35 fighter jets. The tanker capacity will strengthen the air defense of Denmark and ∞increase the fighting power of the Danish defense, including our national operational needs,± Danish Minister of Defence Troels Lund Poulsen said. ∞For example, air refueling capacity creates the precondition for operations with combat aircraft in the Arctic and the North Atlantic.± The Danish government in February agreed to allocate an additional 50 billion kroner to defense over the coming two years, boosting defense spending to more than 3% of GDP in 2025 and 2026. The multinational tanker fleet consists of nine MRTT aircraft, owned and managed by NATO, pooling the resources of the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, Norway, Belgium and Czechia. The six European countries have one more tanker on order for delivery in 2026. Poelsen said ∞there is good potential for Nordic cooperation in the field± of air refueling. The fleet is operated from Eindhoven in the Netherlands, with aircraft also stationed in Cologne, Germany, both around 460 kilometers southwest of the Danish border. The joint tanker fleet was first proposed in 2012, and initiated by the European Defence Agency to address what NATO calls a ∞long-standing shortfall± in European air-to-air refueling capacity. The Airbus A330 MRTT is a multirole aircraft that in addition to carrying 110 metric tons of kerosene can also be used to transport passengers or cargo, with a 45-ton payload capacity. The aircraft can use a boom to refuel aircraft including the F-16 and F-35, and a probe and drogue system for Eurofighter, Tornado, F-18, Gripen and Rafale. Germany is the biggest user of the joint tanker fleet in terms of flight hours, ahead of Belgium and the Netherlands. The fleet started with the Netherlands and Luxembourg jointly buying two A330 MRTTs in 2016, with five additional aircraft ordered in 2017 after Germany and Norway joined the project, with additional tankers ordered in following years after Belgium and Czechia joined. In addition to the six-nation pool, the other A330 MRTT operators in Europe are France with a fleet of 12 of the aircraft and three more on order, and the U.K. with 14 tankers, according to Airbus data at the end of February. Denmarks chief of defense also proposes to invest around 4.7 billion kroner in the 2025-2033 period to accelerate the buildup of the Armys 1st Brigade into a heavy brigade by three to five years, with the construction of two infantry companies, a tactical drone section, a mechanical engineering company and off-road trucks. Denmark said it established an air-defense wing at the Flyvestation Skalstrup military facility, ahead of the acquisition of ground-based air defenses, according to a separate statement on Wednesday. The country officially decommissioned the air defense units operating Hawk missile systems there in 2005. The government said it will look for an interim air-defense solution that can be delivered as early as this year or next year, and pick the system for a permanent solution this year, with a target to finalize the contract by the end of 2025. Denmark earlier this month shortlisted the French-Italian SAMP/T and the U.S. Patriot system to cover the high end of the threat spectrum in its planned purchase of air defense systems, while MBDAs VL MICA system, Kongsbergs NASAMS, the IRIS-T SLM from Diehl Defence and the U.S. IFPC. are in competition for the lower end.

"Boeing wins contract for NGAD fighter jet, dubbed F-47","The Pentagon has awarded the long-awaited contract for the Air Forces Next Generation Air Dominance future fighter jet, known as NGAD, to Boeing, President Donald Trump announced Friday. The sixth-generation fighter, which will replace the F-22 Raptor, will be designated the F-47, Trump said. It will have ∞state-of-the-art stealth technologies [making it] virtually unseeable,± and will fly alongside multiple autonomous drone wingmen, known as collaborative combat aircraft. ∞Its something the likes of which nobody has ever seen before,± Trump said in an Oval Office announcement with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin and Lt. Gen. Dale White, the Air Forces military deputy for acquisition, technology and logistics. ∞In terms of all the attributes of a fighter jet, theres never been anything even close to it, from speed to maneuverability to what it can have [as] payload. And this has been in the works for a long period of time.± ∞Americas enemies will never see it coming,± he continued. Allvin said in a statement the F-47 will be ∞the most advanced, lethal and adaptable fighter ever developed.± ∞We are not just building another fighter,± Allvin said. ∞We are shaping the future of warfare and putting our enemies on notice.± The competition for NGAD was between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, after Northrop Grumman announced in 2023 that it would not compete for the program as a prime contractor. ∞We recognize the importance of designing, building a sixth-generation fighter capability for the United States Air Force,± Steve Parker, the interim president and chief executive of Boeing Defense, Space and Security, said in a release. ∞In preparation for this mission, we made the most significant investment in the history of our defense business, and we are ready to provide the most advanced and innovative NGAD aircraft needed to support the mission.± Lockheed Martin said in a statement that it is disappointed by the result of the NGAD competition but is ∞confident we delivered a competitive solution.± Lockheed did not say whether it was considering a protest of the award. ∞We will await further discussions with the U.S. Air Force on any next steps,± the company said. The F-47 will be the heart of the NGAD concepts ∞family of systems,± which also includes collaborative combat aircraft and cutting-edge sensors, weaponry and other technology that will allow it to better connect with satellites and other aircraft. Air Force officials have consistently said NGAD will be necessary to counter an advanced adversary, such as China. General Atomics and Anduril are building their own CCA candidates the RFQ-42A and RFQ-44A, respectively to be the first iteration of drone wingmen flying alongside the F-35 or F-47. Subsequent generations are on their way. The Air Force wants CCAs to be relatively cheap, piloted with autonomous software and have the ability conduct recon, strike missions, electronic warfare and decoy missions. They are also expected to have advanced adaptive engines, dubbed NGAP or next-generation adaptive propulsion, that shift to the best configuration for any given situation for the best thrust and efficiency. General Electric Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney are in the running to build NGAP. Boeings victory will likely help strengthen the defense industrial base, said Doug Birkey, executive director of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies. It means all three of the U.S. militarys prime aerospace contractors now have deals to build fifth- or sixth-generation stealth penetrating aircraft. Lockheed builds the fifth-generation F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, and Northrop has touted its B-21 Raider as the worlds first sixth-generation plane. ∞For the country, thats a really important thing, to have that innovation, that competition and frankly, the volume production,± Birkey said. ∞Our ability to turn stuff en masse which is what the future world is going to require has been limited, and we need to rebuild the defense industrial base that the current environment demands. Weve been slow to get there. This is an important step in rounding that corner.± But Boeing has struggled company-wide in recent years on both civilian and military aircraft. Nearly 350 people died in a pair of crashes of the companys 737 Max airliners, and last July, the company agreed to a plea deal with the Justice Department to avoid a felony fraud trial related to the crashes. The door plug of another 737 Max blew out in midair in January 2024, and videos from the harrowing scene went viral. Boeings machinists also went on strike for nearly two months last year amid a contract dispute. The aerospace giants T-7A Red Hawk trainer, KC-46A Pegasus tanker and Air Force One programs have struggled with quality problems and delays, and the company has lost billions of dollars in cost overruns. In September 2024, Boeing fired the head of its defense sector, Ted Colbert, amid steep losses. Amid that turmoil, Birkey said, this was an important win for Boeing and now the company must show it can produce. ∞Its up to Boeing to make this opportunity a win,± Birkey said. ∞Only time will tell on that.± The engineering and manufacturing development contract awarded Friday is structured as a cost-plus incentive fee deal, an Air Force official said. Under such a deal, the government pays the contractor to cover expenses as it develops a system, and the contractor also receives a fee that can be adjusted based on how well it performs. That is the same structure used for the early development of Northrop Grummans B-21 Raider stealth bomber. Under this contract, the official said, Boeing will mature, integrate and test all parts of the NGAD crewed fighter, and it will produce a handful of test aircraft. Boeings contract also includes ∞competitively priced± options for building low-rate initial production models of the F-47, the Air Force said. Allvin said in a statement Friday that experimental versions of the NGAD have been flying for the last five years, ∞flying hundreds of hours, testing cutting-edge concepts and proving that we can push the envelope of technology with confidence.± Allvin said the significant advance experimentation and work on the F-47 will allow the service to fly the jet by the end of Trumps administration. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency helped conduct the early experimentation to refine NGAD, the Air Force said. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin presents a display of the F-47, the Air Force's Next Generation Air Dominance fighter. (Screenshot via Defense Department) ∞The F-47 has unprecedented maturity,± Allvin said. ∞While the F-22 is currently the finest air superiority fighter in the world, and its modernization will make it even better, the F-47 is a generational leap forward. The maturity of the aircraft at this phase in the program confirms its readiness to dominate the future fight.± Allvin also scoffed at Chinas claims last December to have test flown its own sixth-generation fighter, the J-36. ∞Despite what our adversaries claim, the F-47 is truly the worlds first crewed sixth-generation fighter, built to dominate the most capable peer adversary and operate in the most perilous threat environments imaginable,± Allvin said. ∞While our X-planes were flying in the shadows, we were cementing our air dominance accelerating the technology, refining our operational concepts, and proving that we can field this capability faster than ever before.± Allvin said the F-47 would cost less than the F-22 and ∞be more adaptable to future threats.± The Air Force will have more NGAD fighters in its fleet than Raptors, he added. The Air Force now has about 180 F-22s, which cost $143 million apiece. Trump declined to disclose the price of NGAD, saying that would reveal some of the jets highly classified technology and size. But the Air Force expects to spend $20 billion on NGAD between 2025 and 2029. The price of NGAD has presented a major vulnerability to the program, one which placed it in jeopardy last year. Former Air Force Sec. Frank Kendall paused the program in May 2024 after cost estimates came in around triple that of the F-35, or as much as $300 million per tail. The pause was needed, Kendall said, to reconsider whether NGAD was the right concept and look for ways to bring its costs down through a redesign. A review of the program concluded that NGAD was necessary, but after the presidential election, Kendall chose to leave the final decision on how to proceed to the incoming Trump administration. The Air Force said decisions on basing the F-47 and other program elements will be made in years to come, as the fighter comes closer to becoming operational. Trump also left the door open to selling versions of NGAD to allies though he said those might be ∞toned-down± versions. ∞Because someday, maybe theyre not our allies, right?± Trump said.

"F-35 partners fully committed to program, Dutch defense minister says","PARIS C The partner countries involved in the Lockheed Martin F-35 remain fully committed to the fighter jet, and theres no sign the United States is changing course on the Joint Strike Fighter program, Dutch Minister of Defence Ruben Brekelmans said. ∞Its in the interest of all of us to make sure that the F-35 program remains operational, that it remains as successful as it is right now, and I dont see any signs of the United States backtracking,± Brekelmans said in a press briefing at the Paris Defence and Strategy Forum on Tuesday, in response to a question citing concerns the U.S. could remotely ground aircraft operated by allies. ∞So, I dont think we should speculate on this,± he added. Some European researchers and lawmakers expressed concern in recent weeks that America might block allies from using their F-35s, as U.S. President Donald Trump appears to increasingly align with Russia and has threatened to annex Canada and Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark. European F-35 operators collaborate with the U.S. to prepare the mission data files critical to operating the jet, and many rely on a U.S.-hosted cloud-based software system for maintenance and updates. The Netherlands as of September had received 40 F-35s out of 52 ordered. That same month, the Dutch announced plans to buy another six of the jets and officially retired their fleet of F-16s. RELATED Defense bill for 2025 would delay F-35 deliveriesKey lawmakers grew frustrated with the F-35 program earlier this year, as critical upgrades stalled and jets piled up at Lockheed Martin's Texas factory. By Stephen Losey Brekelmans pointed out that the F-35 program relies on parts from partner countries, echoing an argument made by Belgian Minister of Defence Theo Francken in a television interview Monday. Francken dismissed comments about a hypothetical F-35 ∞kill switch± as ∞scaremongering stories,± also saying that if the U.S. would stop supplying parts, that would ∞immediately completely shut down± the business of the entire U.S. defense industry in Europe. The U.S. is the ∞biggest partner, and we need to have them on board in order to have a successful F-35 program, but other countries also play a key role,± Brekelmans said, noting the stealth jet has some ∞essential parts that only we produce.± ∞In the end, it is good also for the strength of the United States and for NATO and all of us that we have the most modern air force in the world,± the Dutch minister said. ∞That means we should all be fully committed. And so far, thats what I also see from the partners in the F-35 program.± Lockheed Martin said in a statement last week that the company delivers ∞all system infrastructure and data required for all F-35 customers to sustain the aircraft.± The F-35 capabilities against Russian air defenses cannot currently be replaced or replicated with other platforms, Justin Bronk, senior research fellow for air power at the U.K.s Royal United Services Institute, wrote in a social media post on Monday. ∞On the F-35 fears, I get it there is real dependency,± Bronk said. He added, however, that if countries rely on the U.S. for targeting capacity beyond line-of-sight communications, ISR and munitions to fight a war then dependency on the U.S. for mission data files and software ∞isnt your main problem.± Norway earlier this month received three more F-35 aircraft, bringing its fleet to 49 jets out of 52 the country has ordered. Denmark has received 17 fighters out of 27 ordered. Belgium has been less advanced in building up its fleet, receiving its first F-35 in December, with a total of 34 on order. Poland, meanwhile, started training on its first F-35s in February. The Netherlands continues to see the U.S. as a reliable NATO ally, but the Americans expect European countries to step up and ∞do much more± on defense, according to Brekelmans. ±They do not expect burden sharing, they do expect burden shifting,± Brekelmans said. ∞We should take that message seriously, but we should not speculate on any further steps that the United States is taking because we simply cannot guarantee our security without the U.S. at this moment. That is the reality that we have to work with.± Brekelmans added that the Netherlands is prepared to ∞seriously talk± about sending troops to Ukraine to safeguard any peace agreement with Russia. The minister said he doesnt believe a U.S. backstop is off the table, even if there will be no American boots on the ground. ∞There are also other ways in which you can provide a backstop,± Brekelmans said. ∞And its not only nuclear. In this escalation ladder, there are many steps in between, and we need to make sure that we create those steps.± Any mission in Ukraine would need to be clearly defined and have ∞robust military capabilities± to realize the defined goal, Brekelmans added. The Dutch minister said ∞its very good± that French President Emmanuel Macron last week floated the idea of expanding the French nuclear deterrent to European allies. With China investing in nuclear capabilities and Russia issuing nuclear threats, ∞we also need to have this conversation,± he said. ∞These conversations are very much in early phases and exchange of statements and ideas,± Brekelmans added. ∞Its not [like] right now ... with ministers of defense, that we have sessions about nuclear capabilities or something.± As part of this years bigger budget discussion, the Dutch government will assess whether to raise defense spending above 2% of its GDP, according to Brekelmans. An additional percentage point would mean an additional Ä10 billion to Ä12 billion of spending, which ∞for the Netherlands is a serious amount of money.± The biggest capacity shortages for the Netherlands are in the land forces, and while the Dutch government is planning to buy tanks, ∞the number we invest is relatively low,± Brekelmans said. ∞We need to make sure that our land forces become bigger and stronger, with more heavy equipment and heavier weapon systems.± The war in Ukraine has shown that Dutch Army battalions and brigades need to be able to keep up the fight longer than three months, which means investing in enablers such as supply chain, logistics and medical equipment will be a priority, the minister said. Air defense will be another focus. ∞We need to make sure we have more air defense systems, more missiles, more of everything.± Defense News reporter Stephen Losey contributed to this report.

Sikorsky proves out Ærotor blown wing drone,"Through extensive flight tests earlier this year, Lockheed Martins Sikorsky has proven the capability of a ∞rotor blown wing± unmanned aircraft system that can fly like a helicopter or an airplane, the company announced Monday. The drone is a 115-pound, battery-powered twin prop-rotor aircraft that the company said can be scaled larger, ∞requiring hybrid-electric propulsion.± The company designed the vertical take-off and landing aircraft to ∞fly faster and farther than traditional helicopters,± Rich Benton, Sikorskys vice president and general manager, said in a statement. The drone development took place over the course of a year with the companys rapid prototyping group C Sikorsky Innovations moving through preliminary design, simulation and tethered and untethered flight. In January 2025, Sikorsky Innovations successfully completed more than 40 take-offs and landings with the 10.3-ft composite wingspan aircraft, according to the statement. Sikorsky said the aircraft also performed 30 transitions between helicopter and airplane modes, calling it the ∞most complex maneuver demanded of the design.± The drone also reached a top cruise speed of 86 knots. ∞Our rotor blown wing has demonstrated the control power and unique handling qualities necessary to transition repeatedly and predictably from a hover to high-speed wing-borne cruise flight, and back again,± Igor Cherepinsky, Sikorsky Innovations director, said. ∞New control laws were required for this transition maneuver to work seamlessly and efficiently. The data indicates we can operate from pitching ships decks and unprepared ground when scaled to much larger sizes.± The company envisions future applications for the aircraft in search and rescue, firefighting monitoring, humanitarian response efforts and pipeline surveillance, the statement notes. Larger versions could perform long-range intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and manned-unmanned teaming. Sikorsky will incorporate its MATRIX flight autonomy system in all variants of the drone, according the statement. The company is also developing a 1.2-megawatt hybrid-electric tilt wing demonstrator called HEX that is large enough to carry passengers or cargo on longer-haul flights. Sikorsky plans to demonstrate HEXs hover capability in 2027. Sikorskys technological advancements over the last year come on the heels of the U.S. Armys abrupt cancellation of its Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft, or FARA. The company was competing for the program with a coaxial rotor blade aircraft called Raider X. The company had, over a year prior to the cancellation, lost the Armys other future aircraft competition to Bell. Sikorsky and its Boeing teammate had submitted another larger version of Raider X called Defiant. Since then, Sikorsky hasnt scrapped the promise of its X2 coaxial helicopter technology and continues to pitch it to other potential customers. The company is pursuing a next-generation helicopter for Italy and the NATO Next-Generation Rotorcraft Capability, among others. Lockheed, Airbus and Leonardo were awarded contracts in July 2024 to help NATO develop a new helicopter.

ÆF for fighter: Air Force combat drones get novel mission designation,"AURORA, Colo. The Air Forces first two prototype collaborative combat aircraft have received their mission design series designations and will fly this summer, Chief of Staff Gen. Dave Allvin said Monday. The CCAs, which are being built by Anduril Industries and General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc., are the first aircraft the Air Force has dubbed fighter drones. General Atomics CCA is now known as the YFQ-42A, and Andurils is the YFQ-44A, Allvin said in his keynote address at the Air and Space Forces Associations AFA Warfare Symposium here. In Air Force nomenclature, fighter aircraft are given an F designation, and Q stands for drones. Prototype aircraft are also given a Y prefix, which these CCAs will drop once they enter production. ∞For the first time in our history, we have a fighter designation in the YFQ-42 Alpha and YFQ-44 Alpha,± Allvin said. ∞It may just be symbolic, but we are telling the world we are leaning into a new chapter of aerial warfare.± CCAs are autonomous drones that will one day fly alongside crewed fighters like the F-35, or perhaps the future Next Generation Air Dominance fighter the Air Force is considering. The Air Force is heavily investing in CCAs as a way to expand airpower and provide strike capabilities, conduct reconnaissance, carry out electronic warfare operations, or even act as decoys. Former Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said in 2023 that the service plans to have about 1,000 CCAs, but the exact number of the future fleet is not yet known. The Air Force awarded contracts to Anduril and General Atomics in April 2024 to build the first iteration of CCAs; further so-called ∞increments± are in the works. Anduril's Fury collaborative combat aircraft, shown here at the Air and Space Forces Association's conference in September 2024. (Stephen Losey/Defense News) Until now, General Atomics has referred to its CCA drone as Gambit, and Andurils CCA has been called Fury. In his keynote address, Allvin said CCAs and their core technologies will be crucial for the Air Force to win wars to come. ∞Embracing and leaning into human-machine teaming, understanding what autonomy can do for us,± Allvin said. ∞We know thats got to be a part of our future.± Anduril and General Atomics heralded their aircrafts designations as signs their work is bearing fruit. ∞These aircraft represent an unrivaled history of capable, dependable uncrewed platforms that meet the needs of Americas warfighters and point the way to a significant new era for airpower,± said David Alexander, president of General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc. ∞The designation is evidence of the programs progress, and we continue to work tirelessly to deliver a capability that will expand the United States ability to project combat airpower,± Jason Levin, Andurils senior vice president of engineering, was quoted as saying in a company statement.

Museum exhibit controversy reignites airmans Medal of Honor dispute,"A first-of-its-kind museum honoring recipients of the nations highest combat award is set to open later this month in Arlington, Texas but the project is already dogged by controversy and outrage amid an apparent snub to one medal recipient. A petition on behalf of the late Air Force Master Sgt. John Chapman, a combat controller whose fight to the death in thigh-deep snow during the March 4-5, 2002 Battle of Takur Ghar, Afghanistan, is among the first Medal of Honor actions caught on video, has so far gained nearly 25,000 verified signers and tens of thousands of dollars in donations to promote the cause. The petition, which is hosted on Change.org, calls for the museum, a private enterprise, to create a dedicated exhibit honoring the airman. Chapmans sister and other advocates for his family say he was initially promised such an exhibit and the family was even brought in to discuss it but that plans were changed amid what appears to be a revival of a dark and long-standing interservice dispute. ∞The omission of this crucial element from the exhibits is an ill-conceived misstep and a disservice to Chapmans memory, to his bravery and to the sacrifice he made for the nation,± the Change.org petition states. ∞Please revisit this decision and consider paying fitting tribute to John Chapman in one of the 200 exhibits.± Fallen Air Force Combat Controller Tech. Sgt. John Chapman holds a child during a deployment to Afghanistan. (Air Force) Dave Parke, a veteran of the Marines, Navy and Army who launched the petition after learning about the situation via Chapmans sister, Lori Chapman Longfritz, said hes been astounded by the still-growing response. ∞There are a lot of people who are new to this topic and new to John in general, which I think is amazing,± said Parke, who has long been interested in Chapmans remarkable story. ∞I think he should be a household name, so just getting people who had never heard of him before see this petition, and then, you know, start to do their own research and watch the video thats the secondary benefit that I couldnt have imagined.± Museum officials maintain that Chapmans story will be ∞included from day one,± and emphasized that stories of the 3,526 medal recipients to date will be told in rotation and in forms ranging from a photograph to a full traditional exhibit. Chapmans presence in the museum, they said, will include the drone footage that captured his last fight, and that the video will be part of the museums permanent collection. ∞We have been involved in an ongoing, iterative process of planning exhibits and building a collection of artifacts to support and enrich the museum storytelling experience,± museum CEO Chris Cassidy said in a lengthy statement provided to Military Times. Longfritz said what is set to appear in the museum honoring her brother is a far cry from what she was initially promised. She said she and Chapmans mother, Terri, were hosted at the museum site in early 2024 and told a much more elaborate permanent exhibit, including artifacts from the family, was being planned. Tech. Sgt. John Chapman, shown at the rank of senior airman, was the 19th airman awarded the Medal of Honor since the Air Force was established in 1947. (Air Force) It wasnt until last November, she said, that queries to the museum revealed the reality would be different. ∞We left with high expectations, and so excited,± Longfritz told Military Times. ∞And then when I was told, ÆYeah, you were misled, Im like, I cant, in good conscience, just let people go, spend money to go expecting to see John, and then theres nothing. So, I had to tell people.± An email exchange reviewed by Military Times includes a Jan. 6 email from a museum staffer appearing to confirm that Chapman would not be one of the 200 medal recipients featured in a full exhibit at opening, but noting his photo and the footage would be on display. Chapmans story, uniquely, is closely intertwined with that of another Medal of Honor recipient: Master Chief Special Warfare Operator Britt Slabinski. Both men were on the same mountain, later dubbed Roberts Ridge, and both would initially receive service crosses, the second-highest combat award for valor, for heroism in the close-quarters firefight that would unfold. Chapman, who was attached to the Navy SEAL team, and Slabinski were both inserted on the snowy ridge after another SEAL, Petty Officer First Class Neil Roberts, fell from the back of a team helicopter. Together, according to medal citations, they advanced up the mountain and entered an enemy bunker, killing all the occupants. Roberts was dead on the mountain; and Chapman decided to charge a second bunker from which a machine gunner was firing on the SEALs. During this assault, he was shot and fell, seriously wounded. What followed has been the source of great infighting and dispute. Slabinski, believing Chapman to be dead, led his team to a position of safety further down the mountain, ∞carrying a seriously wounded teammate through deep snow ≠ while calling in fire on the enemy,± according to his medal citation. President Donald Trump awards the Medal of Honor to Master Chief Special Warfare Operator Britt K. Slabinski in 2018. (Susan Walsh/AP) But footage retrieved from a Predator drone and later analyzed showed that Chapman was not dead, and in fact became active again sometime later, mounting a fresh one-man offensive against the enemy, continuing to ∞fight relentlessly± despite mortal wounds, according to his medal citation, until all his ammunition was expended and he could fight no more. Some believe Chapmans actions after the SEAL team departed qualify him for a second Medal of Honor. Yet in 2018, the White House announced that Slabinski would be the first to receive an upgrade to the Medal of Honor, despite allegations hed left a living teammate behind on the mountain. Chapmans Medal of Honor would be awarded posthumously several months later, the first presented to an airman since the Vietnam War. Within the special operations community, the sequence of events spurred outrage and bitter infighting, with some even alleging that the close-knit and image-conscious SEAL community had advocated against Chapmans upgrade to prop up Slabinski. Tech Sgt. John Chapman in Afghanistan Slabinski now serves on the board of the National Medal of Honor Museum. And while Cassidys statement for the museum said no preference was given to board members, and they explicitly asked for no special treatment, the episode aggravates old wounds among advocates for Chapman. Efforts to reach Slabinski for comment through the museum and the C4 Foundation, where he is also a board member, were unsuccessful. Matt Cubbler, a former Army intelligence specialist who has championed Chapmans case and investigated other instances of what he believes to be malfeasance within the SEAL community, has taken to podcasts and YouTube to make the case for a permanent exhibit for Chapman. ∞Its not a matter of John getting an exhibit,± Cubbler said. ∞Its a matter of the fact they continue to steal Johns opportunities to be recognized for his actions by putting forward somebody who left him to die, you know? ≠ And my goal since Lori called me about this is to get as many people angry as I possibly can.± Museum staff have not directly responded to anyone associated with the petition, Parke, Cubbler and Longfritz said. A spokeswoman, Amber MacDowell, said anyone who reaches out to the museum about the Chapman exhibit receives the same statement from Cassidy. For her part, Longfritz said she doesnt know what the museum could do at this point to make the situation right in her eyes. ∞I feel really, really sad that all of this is going to overshadow those people who really, really deserve their exhibits, and they deserve to have a beautiful day of celebration,± she said. ∞But this is going to be a cloud hanging over the museum, and its of their own doing.± Share:"
"General: 8% cuts Æpainful, but could bring fresh funds for Air Force","An Air Force two-star general warned Wednesday that potential 8% cuts to the services budget would be ∞painful.± But Maj. Gen. Joseph Kunkel, the services director for force design, integration and wargaming, expressed hope that the Air Force could still receive additional funding for its top priorities, citing its alignment with the Trump administrations focus on lethality and deterrence and the potential for redirected funding from cost-cutting measures outside the service. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth last week ordered services to review their budgets and find 8% of planned fiscal 2026 spending that could be redirected from noncrucial programs toward efforts that make the military more effective. The Air Force has said one avenue it plans to pursue to meet these goals is accelerating its retirement of older and outdated aircraft. Kunkel said Wednesday that with the Air Force now smaller and older than at any other time in its nearly 80-year history, ∞theres not many places that we can go for± such cuts. ∞An 8% cut to the Air Force, its gonna be painful,± Kunkel said at a discussion hosted in Washington by the think tank the Hudson Institute. ∞Its gonna look really, really bad.± But Kunkel noted that Hegseth plans to redirect funds within the department and that the militarys budget wouldnt be cut overall. The Air Forces top priorities are protecting the homeland, projecting power abroad and strategic deterrence, Kunkel said. The Air Force will look at all its efforts as part of the ∞8% drill,± he said, and anything that doesnt contribute to at least one of those priorities will be reconsidered. The Air Force, with its ability to rapidly employ force across the globe, will become even more important in a future conflict, Kunkel said. However, to win such a war, he said, the service cant continue to operate under the same design, just with updated fighters and bombers. The service will need to fine-tune its capabilities to counter the nations threats and protect its ground-based systems needed to launch aircraft or other weapons, Kunkel said. The Air Forces effort to create a sixth-generation fighter and accompanying systems, known as Next Generation Air Dominance, or NGAD, is now on hold as the service reconsiders how to tame its high costs. Kunkel said that when the Air Force studied how a war would play out with and without NGAD in its fleet, ∞the fight looks much better when NGADs in it.± But NGAD and its accompanying ∞family of systems,± such as drone wingmen, known as collaborative combat aircraft, wouldnt be able to survive alone, he said. The Air Force will need to invest in survivable bases and refueling tankers that can resist enemy attacks, so the service can generate combat sorties and then keep aircraft gassed up, even under fire. If the government decides not to pursue NGAD, Kunkel said, the Air Force will continue to be part of the fight but the operational risk will be higher and the military may not be able to achieve all the combat goals it sets out to. ∞Its a package deal,± Kunkel said. ∞NGAD remains an important part of our force design, and it fundamentally changes the character of the fight in a really good way for the joint force.± About Stephen Losey Stephen Losey is the air warfare reporter for Defense News.

Air Force budget cuts may open old wounds with Congress,"The Air Force wants to accelerate its plans to retire old and outdated aircraft to meet Defense Secretary Pete Hegseths order for services to cut and reallocate a portion of their spending. But the services previous efforts to cut planes like the A-10 Warthog and older F-22 Raptors have shown that making such plans is easy, while actually seeing them through is far trickier. That is because lawmakers who have the power to block cuts they disagree with, or which they fear may harm their constituents, have stymied multiple administrations efforts to tame and reshape Pentagon budgets. If the Trump administration with its focus on cutting perceived government waste is able to break through the logjam on Capitol Hill and enact significant reductions to the Air Forces legacy fleet, it will have accomplished something that has eluded previous administrations. Hegseth last week ordered military leaders to draw up plans to free up 8% of the fiscal 2026 budget the Biden administration prepared before leaving office, to excise ∞woke ... non-lethal programs± and use that money to fund ∞peace through strength± priorities of the new administration. Numerically speaking, the reduction mandate could amount to more than $17 billion in cuts for the Department of the Air Force, $15 billion of which would come from the Air Force alone, with the rest drawn from the sister service, Space Force. ∞Its not a cut,± Hegseth said in a video posted online. ∞Its refocusing and reinvesting existing funds into building a force that protects you, the American people.± But whether they are called cuts or reinvestments, some defense experts worry it wont be as simple as Hegseth makes it sound. Doug Birkey, the executive director for the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, said the Air Force has already been stretched thin for years, and finding 8% of fat to cut will be difficult. ∞For a service that has already cut to the bone over the past 30 years ≠ they have already gone after the easy money,± Birkey said. ∞That was gone years and years ago.± Besides eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs, a fixation for the Trump team, Hegseth also put climate science spending or ∞climate change BS,± as he calls it on the chopping block for the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, headed by billionaire Elon Musk. Under previous administrations, the Pentagon has studied how climate change worsens natural disasters such as hurricanes and floods, which have severely damaged installations such as Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida and Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. Cutting DEI and climate efforts alone may not amount to much in finding 8% of the budget for reprogramming, said Heather Penney, a retired F-16 pilot and senior resident fellow at Mitchell. ∞Its going to be nuanced,± Penney said of cuts on that magnitude. ∞Its not just going to be DEI, because Im not sure that theres $15 billion worth of DEI and climate change programs. I think the service is going to have to look at some of the long-term [research and development] they have.± But cutting research and development would be tricky, Penney warned, because those efforts are crucial investments to make sure the Air Forces capabilities are not outpaced by adversaries in the future. The Next Generation Air Dominance platform and its accompanying high-tech engines are examples of the kind of research the Air Force should not abandon, Birkey said. A sixth-generation fighter is necessary to get the most out of the services collaborative combat aircraft vision, he said, and the Air Force has skimped on modernization so long that it cant miss another generation of fleet upgrades. Curtailing the Air Forces F-35A buy or T-7 Red Hawk trainer program would also be a mistake, Penney argued, but the service could delay its efforts to develop a next-generation refueling tanker. The Air Forces budget proposal for 2025, released last year, called for the service to get $188 billion in funding, 40% of which or $75.6 billion would pay for operations and maintenance. Military personnel costs, including salaries and benefits, accounted for another $41.7, or 22%, and another $37.7 billion was earmarked for research, development, test and evaluation. Procurement accounted for $29 billion, or 16%, and the budget called for another $4 billion for military construction. The Space Force, a relatively fledgling service still working to stand itself up, also doesnt have nearly enough room to trim 8% of its spending, Penney said. That would cut nearly $2.4 billion from the $29.4 billion budget the Biden administration proposed for the Space Force in 2025. ∞The Space Force has no fat to give,± Penney said. ∞They have to grow, and theyre as lean as they possibly can get.± Hegseth said nuclear modernization programs would be among 17 critical functions exempted from the cuts. The Air Force is now working on the LGM-35A Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile, the successor to its Minuteman III nuclear missile, and the B-21 Raider stealth bomber. The Air Forces collaborative combat aircraft program, which aims to create autonomous drone wingmen that fly alongside crewed fighters, is also exempt, Air and Space Forces Magazine reported. But while Hegseth turned his ire on a perceived excess of ∞woke± Biden-era programs as ideal areas to cut, the Air Force is eyeing portions of its fleet the service feels is outdated. ∞The Air Force is focused on retaining our desired warfighting capabilities while proposing the accelerated divestiture of legacy systems that are no longer relevant and consume limited funding and personnel,± an Air Force official told Defense News. ∞The Air Force previously proposed divesting a number of weapon systems but has only recently received congressional authorization to retire the aging A-10 jets.± Air Force leaders have consistently said the service does not want to hold on to aircraft that arent well suited for a future fight, and repeatedly asked lawmakers during budget processes to allow them to retire old planes. This is intended to free up money, airmen and other resources needed to bring on modernized aircraft like the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter. The Air Forces original budget plan for 2025 called for cutting 250 aircraft, which the service said would save about $2 billion. But in several cases, the Air Force and Congress have not seen eye-to-eye on where the services fleet priorities should be. And even when the Air Force has been able to trim its fleet, Birkey said, it hasnt always leveraged those savings effectively. ∞Congress has historically been very, very uncomfortable with the capacity reductions that the Air Force has pursued, and the Air Force has not succeeded in harnessing a divest-to-invest strategy to turn the corner on necessary modernization,± Birkey said. ∞I have yet to find the old car I can sell that will free up enough cash to get the new one I want.± The Air Force isnt replacing retired aircraft with new planes on a one-to-one basis, Penney said, which is slowly eroding its ability to carry out certain missions. ∞Once you give that [kind of combat capability] up, its very hard to get back,± Penney said. ∞Trying to grow your way out of a hole is something the Air Force has not been able to do.± Birkey predicted this time around, Congress would be reluctant to sign off on steep fleet cuts to meet Hegseths goals. The battle over retiring the A-10 was perhaps the most rancorous recent dispute between Congress and the Air Force, although lawmakers in recent years have relented and allowed the Air Force to start retiring the Warthog. The rugged attack jet was frequently employed during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and against the Islamic State to provide close air support to friendly troops and destroy enemy targets. As those wars wound down, the Air Force sought to retire the A-10. Officials said the A-10‰s low-and-slow style would make it vulnerable to attacks from an advanced foe such as China, and it would not be survivable in a future war. But the A-10 had influential backers in Congress in particular, the late Sen. John McCain, whose state of Arizona was the home of a major A-10 base. The dispute over the A-10 reached a fever pitch during an infamous 2016 Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, in which McCain lambasted then-Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Welsh over the departments retirement plans. Congress and the Air Forces dispute over the A-10 thawed in recent years, and lawmakers began allowing those planes to be retired in 2023. The Air Force intends to have all A-10s retired by the end of the decade. More recently, the Air Force has sought to retire 32 Block 20 F-22s that are not able to fly in combat, and would cost too much to get ready for battle. But Congress has repeatedly blocked those retirement efforts. About Stephen Losey Stephen Losey is the air warfare reporter for Defense News.

"For India, its ÆPick your fighter, as Delhi weighs US, Russian bids","BENGALURU, India The cream of the U.S. and Russian air forces shared a runway at the recent Aero India 2025 exhibition in Bengaluru, as both the Lockheed Martin F-35A and Sukhoi Su-57E attempted to woo the Indian Air Force towards an unlikely deal. Emanating from opposing blocs, the surprising juxtaposition of these latest fifth-generation fighters at Aero India, held here Feb. 10-14, illustrates Indias non-aligned stance. Historically, Delhi has relied on Russia for military equipment, though the U.S. has made significant inroads into the market in recent years. The latest competitive jostling surrounds fifth-generation fighters. A Rosoboronexport official said India could manufacture the Su-57 at home with full technology transfer. Russias defense export agency said it has held informal talks with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) on the subject, and believes the Su-57 could be built at HALs Nasik facility where Su-30MKI jets are currently assembled. Ironically, India had previously pulled out of an Indo-Russian collaborative project that ultimately resulted in the Su-57. The Russian Air Force received its first Su-57 in 2020. Alexander Mikheev, director general of Rosoboronexport, declared at the air show here: ∞The first foreign customer of the promising, multifunctional, fifth-generation fighter Su-57E in 2025 will begin operating this aircraft which will be delivered by Rosoboronexport.± A few days later, Algerian media reported that their country is, in fact, the Su-57Es first export customer. Thickening the plot, when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in mid-February, Trump promised he was ∞paving the way to ultimately provide India F-35 stealth fighters.± A joint leaders statement issued Feb. 13 said the U.S. was reviewing ∞its policy on releasing fifth-generation fighters± to India. Trumps vow to put the technologically sensitive F-35 on the table is unprecedented, especially given Indias close relationship with Russia. Lockheed Martin immediately responded: ∞Were encouraged by the recent announcement by President Trump to provide the F-35 to India. We look forward to working closely with both governments on upcoming strategic procurements, including the fighters.± Trumps dangling offer of the F-35 took Delhi by surprise. ∞I dont think, with regard to the acquisition of an advanced aviation platform by India, that process has started as yet,± an Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson said. ∞So this is currently something thats at the stage of a proposal.± India has an airpower gap with nemesis China, but it is unclear whether the F-35 is the right solution. Apart from the U.S. being paranoid about F-35 technologies falling into the wrong hands, how would the advanced fighter integrate into Indias existing command-and-control networks? The F-35 will unlikely be permitted to plug into networks containing Indias backbone of Russian-designed Su-30MKI fighters, for example. The unexpected Russian Su-57E and American F-35 offers also come amidst Modis efforts to boost defense equipment self-reliance. In fact, India is presently pursuing its own indigenous, fifth-generation Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) program. The government displayed a full-scale model of the AMCA for the first time at Aero India 2025. The project promises, optimistically, first fighter deliveries in 2034. However, buying either the F-35 or Su-57 runs the risk of asphyxiating Indias AMCA effort. A model of India's fifth-generation AMCA fighter is on display at Aero India 2025. (Gordon Arthur/staff) India has signed $50 billion in defense contracts with Russia over the past 20 years. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute reported that 36% of Indian defense imports came from Russia over 2019-2023. However, this represented a 34% drop compared to the preceding 2014-2018 timeframe. As the worlds largest weapon importer from 2008-2023, India accounted for 10% of global arms imports. In that same period, according to a recent U.S. Congressional Research Service report, 62% of Delhis military imports came from Russia, 11% from France, 10% from the U.S. and 7% from Israel. The same report remarked, ∞The U.S. government is actively encouraging India to reduce its dependence on Russian-origin defense articles.± India is too important a market for the U.S. to ignore. Prior to 2008, American sales of defense articles to Delhi were virtually nonexistent, but since then it has accrued more than US$20 billion in sales. Important American exports include C-130J Super Hercules, C-17A Globemaster IIIs, P-8I aircraft, CH-47F Chinooks, MH-60Rs, AH-64E Apaches, Hellfire and Stinger missiles, M777A2 howitzers, SIG Sauer SIG716 assault rifles and Harpoon anti-ship missiles. Indias latest American deal, worth a mammoth $4 billion, is for 31 MQ-9B drones. The Trump-Modi statement noted a ∞deepening convergence of U.S.-India strategic interests.± To further advance defense ties, the two will sign a new ten-year framework for a major defense partnership later this year. The statement also announced plans to ∞pursue this year new procurements and co-production arrangements± for Javelin missiles, Stryker 8x8 vehicles and six additional P-8I maritime patrol aircraft ∞following agreement on sale terms.± Earlier this month, India declared a 9.53% hike to $78.3 billion in its 2025-2026 defense budget. ∞In the current geopolitical scenario where the world is witnessing a changing paradigm of modern warfare, the Indian Armed Forces need to be equipped with state-of-the-art weapons and have to be transformed into a technologically advanced combat-ready force,± reads a Ministry of Defence statement. Delhi now has a choice C to renew reliance on Russia by buying the Su-57E; continue switching allegiance to the U.S. with an F-35 order; or spurn both by putting all its eggs in the AMCA basket and accepting a prolonged capability gap vis-§-vis China in the near term.

Pentagon expands list of commercial drones certified for military use,"The Defense Innovation Unit announced Feb. 14 it has selected 37 systems and components to add to its list of commercial drone capabilities certified for military use, pending final approvals to ensure they meet congressionally mandated cybersecurity and supply chain standards. DIU in November staged a three-day flight demonstration at Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms in California. Following the event, the department selected 23 systems as well as 14 unique drone components, which are now in the midst of a months-long cybersecurity verification process. Once completed, the approved drones will be added to DIUs Blue Unmanned Aircraft Systems, or UAS, List and the components to its Blue UAS Framework, making them available for the military services to buy. ∞Advocacy for many of these new and enabling technologies continues to be critical for getting capabilities to the warfighter,± DIU said in a statement. ∞With the cycle for development of new capabilities in this space approaching three months, and current DOD timelines and processes for drone delivery lagging warfighter needs by multiple years, providing warfighters access to capabilities they need now through the Blue List and Framework is even more important.± Small commercial drones have featured heavily in recent military conflicts, including those in Ukraine and the Middle East. As the market for these capabilities has grown, particularly in China, the U.S. government has been increasingly concerned about the security of the technology and the possibility that data collected by these systems could be shared with adversaries. That concern led to a series of congressional mandates blocking the Pentagon from buying or using certain drone components made by Chinese companies. Units wanting access to commercial drones had to go through an intensive exemption process to get a waiver that lasted only six months before needing to be resubmitted. DIU established Blue UAS in 2020 to create another avenue for validation. Since then, the organization has on-ramped 15 systems. It also created an inventory of approved components and software through its Blue UAS Framework. Although the Blue effort has essentially become the government standard for commercial drone procurement, DIU has heard from companies and DOD users that the process was not meeting their needs. Military units said the list wasnt providing the types of systems the military most urgently needs. Meanwhile, drone firms said there were too many financial and procedural hoops to jump through to get on it. To address those concerns, DIU opted to refresh the Blue UAS List and build out the Blue UAS Framework effort. In response, firms from the U.S. and 18 partner countries applied to participate in last falls demonstrations. The drones selected through that event are: Hoverfly Spectre, Neros Archer, ModalAI Stalker, Zone 5 Paladin, Teledyne FLIR Black Hornet, Parrot Anafi UKR, Skyfront Perimeter 8, Mountain Horse Solutions Rotron DT-300, Vantage Robotics Trace, Easy Aerial Sparrow, Shield AI V-BAT, Edge Autonomy VXE-30 Stalker, Skyfall Vampire, Quantum Systems Vector, AeroVironment Dragon, Zepher Flight Z1, Kraus Hamdani Aerospace K1000, Teal Black Widow, Freefly Systems Astro, Skydio X10D, Flightwave Edge 130, PDW C100 and Anduril Ghost/GhostX. Notably, the list features drones from Ukrainian companies, including Skyfalls Vampire and Parrots Anafi drone. It also has several first-person-view drones, which can wirelessly transmit video feeds to displays like goggles or headsets. The addition of FPV systems and tethered platforms came in direct response to feedback from military users, DIU said.

"Deterring China, slashing waste top Pentagon priorities, Hegseth says","Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Friday pledged to demonstrate to China that the United States will continue supporting its allies in the Indo-Pacific region. The U.S., however, is not going to create unnecessary conflict with Beijing, Hegseth said in a question-and-answer session during a town hall with Defense Department personnel. ∞Were clear-eyed about the communist Chinese, the [Peoples Republic of China], but were also not attempting to initiate conflict or create conflict where it otherwise doesnt need to exist,± Hegseth said. ∞Were going to stand strong with our partners. And then President Trump, at his strategic level, is the one whos having the conversations to sort of ensure that we dont ever have a conflict. ∞We dont want that, [the Chinese] dont want that,± Hegseth continued. ∞We just have to remain strong in order to be in the best possible position.± The Pentagon posted a transcript of the town hall Friday evening, after a livestream of the event was cut off following Hegseths 15 minutes of opening remarks. Hegseths comments about China came after an Air Force official asked him whether the Defense Department would be more assertive in the ∞gray zone± area short of war to deter China and Russia. ∞Theres gray zone activities that exist, some of which you can acknowledge, some of which you cannot,± Hegseth said. ∞But certainly, we want to send the signals to China that the [Indo-Pacific] area will be and continues to be contested.± In response to a question about potential staff cuts at DOD, Hegseth also said that ∞there are thousands of additional ≠ positions [across the Defense Department] that have been created over the last 20 years that dont necessarily translate to battlefield success.± ∞[There are] additional staff, additional layers of bureaucracy [and] additional flag officer positions that we would be remiss if we did not review,± he said. Hegseth noted that the department operates in a ∞budget constrained environment,± and highlighted the armored cavalry unit at Fort Bliss, which has had to cut a series of upcoming training assignments due to tight budgets. ∞When youre living off of continuing resolutions and caps, and then you have contingency operations and things that change, suddenly you have shortfalls and now unit training falls by the wayside,± Hegseth said. ∞From my perspective, thats completely unacceptable.± Hegseth said that in addition to rooting out waste, fraud and abuse, the Pentagon needs to slash hierarchies and layers of bureaucracy that arent serving the military. That could also involve a reduction in the number of four-star generals and flag officers, he said. ∞We won World War II with seven four-star generals,± Hegseth said. ∞Today we have 44. Do all of those directly contribute to warfighting success? Maybe they do. I dont know, but its worth reviewing to make sure they do.± During the town hall an official from the Pentagons Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation office, which provides independent analysis on DOD programs, asked whether the militarys acquisition process should focus on smaller capabilities that could be fielded more quickly, or larger-scale capabilities that can do more to deter adversaries. ∞In a perfect world, I would say both,± Hegseth said, citing the effectiveness of low-cost drones in the war in Ukraine. The Pentagon can work with Silicon Valley and fast-moving new contractors that are able to rapidly field new systems, he said. And the Pentagon needs to speed up its testing process so commanders can see how new systems work in the field, and then scale up production once its clear how much practical use those new technologies have. Additionally, Hegseth noted one question that highlighted the challenges facing military families, such as frequent moves, was ∞100% right.± And he suggested that massive military programs may need to take a backseat to family concerns. Families frustrations are ∞a massive readiness and retention issue and a morale issue,± he said. ∞Funding one more multibillion-dollar system is not as important as funding the families and the capabilities of our human systems that make it all happen.± About Stephen Losey Stephen Losey is the air warfare reporter for Defense News.

Applied Intuition acquires AI software firm EpiSci,"Software company Applied Intuition announced Thursday it acquired Silicon Valley autonomy firm EpiSci, whose technology has supported a slew of Pentagon programs aimed at integrating AI with military platforms. The move positions Applied, which has until now focused largely on dual-use autonomous technology for land systems, to expand its portfolio into other domains. ∞Weve done a lot of on-the-ground, land autonomy,± Applieds CEO Qasar Younis told Defense News. ∞And we thought one area we could augment its portfolio is in other domains in the air and on the sea ... and space as well.± EpiSci, founded in 2012, builds AI software for a number of defense applications, including surface warfare, maritime tracking, space-based missile tracking satellites and uncrewed aircraft. Last year, the Air Force used the companys software to stage the first-ever dogfights between an F-16 and an experimental fighter jet, the X-62A VISTA. RELATED US Air Force stages dogfights with AI-flown fighter jetThe Air Force hopes that teaching AI to dogfight -- perhaps the hardest flying style to master -- will make it easier to autonomously fly other missions. By Stephen Losey Meanwhile, Applied has developed a suite of simulation, validation and data management software. The firms technology is used by a range of industries from automotive, trucking and agriculture to defense. In 2022, the Army and the Defense Innovation Unit selected the firm to provide a platform to develop and test autonomous software for the Robotic Combat Vehicle program. And last month, the Pentagons Chief Digital and AI Office awarded the company a production contract worth up to $171 million for its software development and testing platform. Jason Brown, general manager of Applieds defense business, said the Defense Departments focus on uncrewed systems specifically through the Replicator initiative to field thousands of low-cost expendable drones is driving significant growth in the autonomy market. That growth means more opportunities not only for drone manufacturing firms, but for companies like Applied and EpiSci, that can equip both new and legacy systems with autonomy software. ∞We want to be a part of that,± Brown said in the same interview with Younis. ∞This is potentially retrofitting a lot of existing legacy systems. This is a big market that is about to explode. Were going to be able to take advantage of all of it.± About Courtney Albon Courtney Albon is C4ISRNETs space and emerging technology reporter.

"AI, advanced tech central to new Marine Corps aviation plan","The U.S. Marine Corps released a revised aviation strategy Monday that focuses on using autonomous systems, drones and artificial intelligence-driven software to ensure its aircraft fleet can survive in a fierce war zone. And the Corps is also shifting its procurement plans for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter to buy more carrier-based F-35Cs and fewer of the B variants that can hover and vertically land. The Corps billed its 2025 Marine Corps Aviation Plan, the services first in three years, as a ∞roadmap to enhancing operational readiness and ensuring Marine aviation remains a lethal force.± A centerpiece of the plan, signed by deputy commandant for aviation Lt. Gen. Bradford Gering, is a modernization strategy the Corps calls ∞Project Eagle.± ∞We are committed to shaping a future aviation force that is ready, resilient and capable of rapidly responding to emerging threats, wherever they may arise,± Col. Derek Brannon of Headquarters Marine Corps Aviation said. ∞Project Eagle builds on the progress weve made, and it prepares us to embrace technological innovation while ensuring we can deliver combat power across all domains.± Project Eagle focuses on using advanced technology like AI alongside new concepts for generating Marine airpower, such as distributed aviation operations and decision-centric aviation operations, to ensure its aircraft can fight and operate in highly contested environments. Distributed aviation operations focus on coordinating how the Marine Corps uses its aviation squadrons, command-and-control agencies, aviation logistics and ground support units, spread out across battlefields in a way that makes it harder for enemies to target them. This can include pushing command-and-control authorities to lower levels and keeping forces moving. The decision-centric aviation operations concept aims to rapidly accelerate how quickly aviation elements make choices using cutting-edge technologies such as AI. To become a ∞data centric and data enabled organization,± the plan said, Marine aviation needs to invest in infrastructure, personnel and training and make ∞transformative± leaps to use cutting-edge technologies. ∞Linear incremental change will not be sufficient,± the plan said. The plan also calls for Marine aviation to dedicate resources and funding to develop advanced capabilities such as future drones supporting logistics, advancements in aircraft survivability and ∞manned-unmanned teaming,± or pairing crewed aircraft with autonomous drone wingmen. The Marine Corps is also shifting its F-35 plans to buy more carrier-based F-35Cs and fewer short takeoff and vertical landing F-35Bs as part of the plan, although the total number of Joint Strike Fighters the service plans to buy will remain unchanged at 420. The Corps now plans to buy 280 F-35Bs and 140 F-35Cs, more than doubling the number of F-35Cs included in the 2022 plan, which called for 353 F-35Bs and 67 F-35Cs. The Marines intend to transition four Marine Fighter Attack Squadrons VMFA-232, VMFA-323, VMFA-112 and VMFA-134 to F-35C squadrons, leaving the Corps with 12 F-35B squadrons and 8 F-35C squadrons. The Corps expects to have 183 F-35Bs and 52 F-35Cs delivered by the end of 2025, according to the plan. The service aims to accelerate research and development on drone wingmen, known as collaborative combat aircraft, and get them flying alongside F-35s. The plan also focuses on improving how the Marine Corps sustains its aircraft and said traditional methods that were previously effective ∞are no longer sufficient to meet the challenges operating in current and future contested environments.± Sustainment changes being planned by the Corps include redesigning support equipment to make them more efficient, safe and effective; modernizing training systems; making greater use of additive manufacturing, digital modeling and other technologies to improve the supply chain; and encouraging aviation sustainment Marines to innovate and experiment to find better ways to keep aircraft flying.

Air Force triples funding for prototype sixth-gen fighter engine,"The Air Force on Monday greatly expanded funding for the prototype engine for the services planned sixth-generation fighter. General Electric of Cincinnati, Ohio, and Pratt & Whitney Engines of East Hartford, Connecticut, each received modifications to their initial Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion, or NGAP, contracts that bring the maximum amount for the prototype phase up to $3.5 billion apiece. That is more than three times higher than the $975 million ceiling on the original contracts awarded in 2022. NGAP is expected to be the propulsion system for the planned Next Generation Air Dominance fighter. GE and Pratt are designing so-called ∞adaptive± engines, which shift to the most efficient thrust configuration for whatever situation a jet is in, to power NGAD. The Pentagon seriously considered upgrading the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter with adaptive engines. But their cost and limited ability to fit all models of the F-35 led the Pentagon to instead upgrade the F-35‰s current engines. The progress made on adaptive engines is now feeding into the NGAP program. And even as the Air Force reconsiders its approach to NGAD and air dominance, the contract modification signals the service wants to keep work moving on the new engines. The Pentagon said this contract award will help deliver ∞a state-of-the-art propulsion system with a flexible architecture that can be tailored for future combat aircraft operating across various mission threads, and digitally transforming the propulsion industrial base.± The Pentagon expects the work to be done by July 2032. Chris Calio, president and chief executive of Pratts parent company, RTX, said the additional funding will help the company continue driving down the risks on its adaptive engine, dubbed ∞XA103.± ∞Weve gone through rigorous testing over the last few years,± Calio said in an earnings call with investors Tuesday. ∞Weve been really pleased with the results there.± Pratt & Whitney said in February 2024 that the XA103 had finished a key design review with the Air Force and was on its way to ground testing in the late 2020s. GE said in May 2024 that its NGAP engine, the XA102, finished a major design review in December 2023 and was moving towards a prototype engine test. The Air Force has pushed for years to develop NGAD C envisioned as a ∞family of systems± including a sixth-generation crewed fighter, as well as drone wingmen known as collaborative combat aircraft and other advanced systems and weapons C to modernize its fleet and replace the F-22. The program is suffering from major sticker shock, however, with initial cost estimates coming in at three times as much as an F-35, or between $250 million and $300 million. The Air Force balked and put NGAD on hold in summer 2024 as it reconsidered what the best and most cost-effective way to maintain air dominance might be. After Trump was reelected, the Air Forces previous leadership decided it would be more appropriate to let the new administration decide its path forward.

F-15Es with new electronic-warfare system make their debut in the UK,"The first two F-15E Strike Eagles rigged with the latest war-fighting software touched down in the United Kingdom last week, according to the Air Force. The duo of F-15Es arrived at Royal Air Force Lakenheath, England, on Jan. 16, equipped with the Eagle Passive Active Warning Survivability System, or EPAWSS. The system allows F-15 fighters to detect and jam threats through geolocation and radar warning, helping them survive in dangerous environments. The jets will be absorbed into the 494th and 492nd Fighter Squadrons. ∞Having EPAWSS operational at RAF Lakenheath significantly enhances our ability to detect and counter threats, ensuring the safety and effectiveness of our crews,± said 494th Fighter Squadron Commander Lt. Col. Timothy Causey. ∞This advanced electronic warfare system, when combined with the F-35s, acts as a powerful force multiplier, transforming our operations and amplifying the 48th Fighter Wings impact in the battlespace.± The Air Force approved the advanced electronic warfare system for full-scale production Jan. 6 and awarded Boeing a $616 million contract to construct EPAWSS production kits. The kits will be produced in Nashua, New Hampshire, and St. Louis. Boeing will do the installation work at its San Antonio location, where F-15 EPAWSS installations have taken place since July 2022. RELATED Air National Guard gets services first combat-ready F-15EXThe jet is the first F-15EX slated for delivery to the Air Force as it modernizes its fighter fleet. By Stephen Losey Boeing contracted BAE to help churn out the initial EPAWSS kit in March 2021 and stamped another contract in September 2022 with the British defense company to continue the softwares production. BAE implemented the use of artificial intelligence to uniquely enhance an aspect of the EPAWSS system called cognitive electronic warfare, in which the system can rapidly adapt to changing threat landscapes. The cutting-edge EPAWSS was developed as part of an ongoing effort to modernize the F-15E fleet. The system allows the F-15 to penetrate further beyond enemy lines and ∞boosts pilots situation awareness by autonomously detecting, identifying and locating threat systems,± the Air Force said in a statement. As of Jan. 10, the EPAWSS system was being flown on F-15 jets at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada and Portland Air National Guard Base in Oregon.

"Amid Houthi threats, a mysterious airstrip appears on Yemeni island","DUBAI, United Arab Emirates A mysterious airstrip being built on a remote island in Yemen is nearing completion, satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press show, one of several built in a nation mired in a stalemated war threatening to reignite. The airstrip on Abd al-Kuri Island, which rises out of the Indian Ocean near the mouth of the Gulf of Aden, could provide a key landing zone for military operations patrolling that waterway. That could be useful as commercial shipping through the Gulf and Red Sea a key route for cargo and energy shipments heading to Europe has halved under attacks by Yemens Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. The area also has seen weapons smuggling from Iran to the rebels. The runway is likely built by the United Arab Emirates, which has long been suspected of expanding its military presence in the region and has backed a Saudi-led war against the Houthis. While the Houthis have linked their campaign to the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, experts worry a ceasefire in that conflict may not be enough to see the rebels halt a campaign thats drawn them global attention. Meanwhile, the Houthis have lobbed repeated attacks at Israel, as well as U.S. warships operating in the Red Sea, raising fears that one may make it through and endanger the lives of American service members. A battlefield miscalculation by Yemens many adversarial parties, new fatal attacks on Israel or a deadly assault on an American warship could easily shatter the countrys relative calm. And it remains unclear just how President-elect Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated Monday, will handle the emboldened rebel group. ∞The Houthis feed off war war is good for them,± said Wolf-Christian Paes, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies who studies Yemen. ∞Finally they can live up to their slogan, which famously, of course, declares, ÆDeath to America, death to the Jews. They see themselves as being in this epic battle against their archenemies and from their view, they're winning.± Satellite images show airstrip nearly complete Satellite photos taken Jan. 7 by Planet Labs PBC for AP show trucks and other heavy equipment on the north-south runway built into Abd al-Kuri, which is about 21 miles in length and about 3 miles at its widest point. The runway has been paved, with the designation markings ∞18± and ∞36Â to the airstrips north and south, respectively. As of Jan. 7, there was still a segment missing from the 1.5-mile-long runway thats 150 feet wide. Trucks could be seen grading and laying asphalt over the missing 950-foot segment. Once completed, the runways length would allow private jets and other aircraft to land there, though likely not the largest commercial aircraft or heavy bombers given its length. This satellite photo from Planet Labs PBC shows an airstrip on Abd al-Kuri Island in Yemen on Jan. 7. (Planet Labs PBC via AP) While within Houthi drone and missile range, the distance of Abd al-Kuri from mainland Yemen means ∞theres no threat of the Houthis getting on a pickup truck or a technical and going to seize it,"" said Yemen expert Mohammed al-Basha of the Basha Report risk advisory firm. The United Nations Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization, which assigns its own set of airport codes for airfields around the world, had no information about the airstrip on Abd al-Kuri, spokesman William Raillant-Clark said. Yemen, as a member state to ICAO, should provide information about the airfield to the organization. Nearby Socotra Island already has an airport declared to the ICAO. Its not the only airfield to see an expansion in recent years. In Mocha on the Red Sea, a project to extend that citys airport now allows it to land far larger aircraft. Local officials attributed that project to the UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms home to Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The airfield also sits on a similar north-south path as the Abd al-Kuri airstrip and is roughly the same length. Other satellite photos from Planet Labs show yet another unclaimed runway currently under construction just south of Mocha near Dhubab, a coastal town in Yemens Taiz governorate. An image taken by Planet for AP on Thursday showed the runway fully built, though no markings were painted on it. A key location for a country riven by war Abd al-Kuri is part of the Socotra Archipelago, separated from Africa by only 60 miles and from Yemen by some 250 miles. In the last decade of the Cold War, the archipelago occasionally hosted Soviet warships due to its strategic location. In recent years, the island has been overseen by Yemens Southern Transitional Council, which advocates for Yemen to again split into a separate north and south as it was during the Cold War. The UAE has backed and armed the council as part of the Saudi-led war against the Houthis, who seized Yemens capital, Sanaa, in 2014. The UAE, home to the massive Jebel Ali port in Dubai and the logistic firm DP World, previously built a base in Eritrea that was later dismantled and attempted to build an airstrip on Mayun, or Perim, Island, in the center of the strategic Bab el-Mandeb Strait between the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. But unlike those efforts, the Emiratis appear likely to open the Abd al-Kuri airstrip and have even signed their work. Just east of the runway, piles of dirt there have spelled out ∞I LOVE UAE± for months. An Emirati-flagged landing craft also was spotted off the coast of Abd al-Kuri in January 2024 and off Socotra multiple other times in the year, according to data analyzed by AP from MarineTraffic.com. That vessel previously has been associated with the UAEs military operations in Yemen. The airstrip's construction comes as Houthi rebels have continued their attacks on commercial shipping, U.S. warships and Israel over the war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

(Osamah Abdulrahman/AP) The UAE, which runs a once-a-week flight to Socotra via Abu Dhabi, has long described its efforts as aimed at getting aid to the archipelago. Asked for comment about the Abd al-Kuri airfield, the UAE similarly pointed to its aid operations. ∞Any presence of the UAE ≠ is based on humanitarian grounds that is carried out in cooperation with the Yemen government and local authorities,± the Emirati government said in a statement. ∞The UAE remains steadfast in its commitment to all international endeavors aimed at facilitating the resumption of the Yemeni political process, thereby advancing the security, stability and prosperity sought by the Yemeni populace.± The Emirates on Friday also prominently marked the third anniversary of a 2022 Houthi missile attack on Abu Dhabi that killed three people at a fuel depot. The countrys leader, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi, wrote on the social media platform X that the day is ∞when we remember the strength, resilience and solidarity of the people of the UAE.± The Southern Transitional Council and officials with Yemens exiled government did not respond to repeated requests for comments over the airfield. The UAEs presence on Socotra has sparked tensions in the past, something the Houthis have used to portray the Emiratis as trying to colonize the island. ∞This plan represents a serious violation of Yemeni sovereignty and threatens the sovereignty of several neighboring countries through the espionage and sabotage operations it is expected to carry out,± the Houthi-controlled SABA news agency said in November. Smuggling route passes by the island A new airport on Abd al-Kuri could provide a new, secluded landing zone for surveillance flights around Socotra Island. That could be vital to interdict weapons smuggling from Iran to the Houthis, who remain under a U.N. arms embargo. A report to the U.N. Security Council said a January 2024 weapons seizure by the U.S. military took place off Socotra near Abd al-Kuri. That seizure, which saw two U.S. Navy SEALs lost at sea and presumed killed, involved a traditional dhow vessel that U.S. prosecutors say was involved in multiple smuggling trips on behalf of Irans paramilitary Revolutionary Guard to the Houthis. Disrupting that weapons route, as well as the ongoing attacks by the U.S., Israel and others on the Houthis, likely have contributed to the slowing pace of the rebels attacks in recent months. The U.S. and its partners alone have struck the Houthis over 260 times, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Next week, Trump will be the one to decide what happens to that campaign. He has experience already with how difficult fighting in Yemen can be his first military action in his first term in 2017 saw a Navy SEAL killed in a raid on a suspected al-Qaida compound. The raid also killed more than a dozen civilians, including an 8-year-old girl. Trump may reapply a foreign terrorist organization designation on the Houthis that Biden revoked, a reimposition that the UAE backs. Marco Rubio, who Trump has nominated to be secretary of state, mentioned the Houthis several times when testifying Wednesday at his Senate confirmation hearing alongside what he described as threats from Iran and its allies. Any U.S. move could escalate the war, even with the Houthi's enigmatic supreme leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, pledging Thursday night to halt the rebels' attacks if a ceasefire deal is reached in Gaza. ∞I dont see a way in 2025 that we have a de-escalation with the Houthis,± said al-Basha, the Yemen expert. ∞The situation in Yemen is very tense. An outbreak in the war could be a reality in the next few months. I dont foresee the status quo continuing.± Share: More In Mideast Africa Space Force commercial office eyes pilot for quick-reaction launchesThe Commercial Space Office plans to start a pilot by this fall with a tabletop exercise.

How Trumps Air Force pick could elevate space priorities,"Among the resumes of President-elect Donald Trumps picks for key Pentagon posts, aspiring Air Force secretary Troy Meinks stands out. As a Defense Department insider with deep acquisition and technology-development experience, Meink would bring to the job a government background unlike that of Trumps other DOD nominees. And his specialization in space could upend the priorities of a service typically dominated by Air Force interests. Todd Harrison, a senior defense policy fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said choosing a space expert like Meink to lead the Air Force is ∞consequential± and indicates that space will be a high priority under the Trump administration. ∞He is solidly from a space background, unlike any other secretary of the Air Force,± Harrison told Defense News. ∞I think that it must be intended to send a message that the Trump administration means business when it comes to the Space Force and the prioritization of the Space Force.± In Meinks current role as deputy director of the National Reconnaissance Office, or NRO, he oversees the day-to-day operations of the spy agency, which provides space-based intelligence to the military. Throughout his career, hes held positions in the Air Force space community, including stints at the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center and in the office of the deputy undersecretary of the Air Force for space. If confirmed, Meink will lead the Air Force and the Space Force at a time when both services face important decisions about the size and shape of their future force. For the Air Force, that means designing a next-generation fighter fleet, modernizing two legs of the nuclear triad and determining how to integrate more autonomy and uncrewed aircraft across its portfolio. Meanwhile, the Space Force C which was created five years ago under the first Trump administration C is looking to double or triple its budget in the coming years to get after growing threats and new missions alike. The next Air Force secretary will decide how resources are distributed between the two services, and a leader with Meinks space expertise could shift more funding toward the Space Force, whose $30 billion budget for fiscal 2025 is a fraction of the Air Forces $188 billion request. RELATED Securing US space assets is busting the Air Force budget, Kendall saysMoney for space ""is going to need to double or triple over time,± the Air Force secretary said in an interview, with a resilient architecture top of mind. By Courtney Albon ∞The airpower advocates out there are probably very worried about this pick because were in an era where the budget is not growing,± Harrison said. ∞If the Space Force is going to grow in priority and grow in funding, that may very well come at the expense of the Air Force.± Harrison noted that Meink will also inherit decisions around how to transition missions, such as moving target indication typically performed from the air to space sensors and satellites. ∞I think he will bring, perhaps, a preference or a healthy kind of new perspective on the trade-offs between air and space,± he said. ∞There are a number of mission areas that are ripe to move from the Air Force side to the Space Force side. Some of thats already starting to happen, some of it could be accelerated.± During Meinks tenure at the NRO, the largely classified agencys public-facing successes have included launching more than 100 ISR satellites as part of a proliferated constellation in low Earth orbit and partnering more closely with commercial companies for satellite imagery and other services. Kari Bingen, director of the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and principal deputy undersecretary for intelligence during Trumps first term, said Meink has been at the leading edge of advancing data processing and analytic capabilities an expertise that will serve both the Air Force and the Space Force well. ∞He grounds himself in technical facts and analysis,± she said. ∞Whether its a space issue or an air issue, hes going to approach it thoughtfully and substantively.± Meinks NRO background also will likely inform his perspective on the distinct roles and responsibilities of the Space Force and the intelligence community a sometimes heated topic as the service takes on new missions. The first Trump administration pushed for greater collaboration between the organizations and even proposed consolidating the NRO under the Space Force. Doug Loverro, a former Pentagon space policy official, said Meinks experience could help smooth out some of those discussions. ∞This helps make that process work better because now youll have somebody who understands both sides equally well,± he said.

Trump picks intel community official as next Air Force secretary,"President-elect Donald Trump said Thursday hes tapping Troy Meink, second in command at the National Reconnaissance Office, to be secretary of the Air Force. Meink began his career as a KC-135 tanker navigator in 1988. He went on to hold a variety of roles across the Air Forces space enterprise, serving as a chief technical advisor to the Air Force Research Laboratory and later the deputy undersecretary of the Air Force for space. As principal director of the NRO, a position hes held since 2020, Meink oversees the spy agencys day-to-day operations. Hes played a key role in discussions around how to collaborate with the Space Force to provide ground target tracking capabilities from space, as well as the NROs efforts to leverage space-based commercial imagery services and launch a proliferated satellite constellation. If confirmed, Meink will lead both the Air Force and the Space Force. His background in space-system acquisition and development could drive more funding toward Space Force priorities as the service looks to double or triple its budget in the coming years to meet an expanding mission set. His nomination comes as the Air Force faces a significant decision about how to fund its current and future portfolio of fighter aircraft, as well as its nuclear modernization programs. Last year, outgoing Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall paused the services competitive Next-Generation Air Dominance Program a major effort to replace the F-22 stealth fighter pointing to concerns about the programs cost and requirements. The intent of the pause was to give Air Force leadership time to determine whether and how to reshape the program. Kendall ultimately punted that decision to his successor. Meink is also likely to face decisions on what role unmanned aircraft will play across the Air Force portfolio. Trump adviser Elon Musk has suggested the service should abandon efforts to build a crewed fighter to replace the F-35, advocating instead for a heavier focus on drones. Speaking earlier this week at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Kendall said he doesnt think the Air Force is culturally ready to make that shift. ∞The culture and history and the legacy of the Air Force, which I have been steeped in ... for my whole life, really, is about the role of the pilot,± Kendall said. ∞Letting go, to some degree, of that, is an incredibly difficult emotional thing for people to do.± About Courtney Albon Courtney Albon is C4ISRNETs space and emerging technology reporter.

"Kendall floats F-35 successor, casts 2050 vision for Air Force","The Air Force under a Trump administration could choose to pursue a more advanced successor to the F-35 instead of the costly Next Generation Air Dominance platform to maintain air superiority, outgoing Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said Monday. Kendall suggested alternative paths for the Air Forces future combat fleet at a Center for Strategic and International Studies event at the think tanks Washington headquarters, in which he outlined a report on where the department needs to be in the next 25 years. Authored by Kendall, the report, titled ∞The Department of the Air Force in 2050,± amounts to a sort of valedictory in the waning days of his leadership of the department and a warning of the threats it could face in decades to come. ∞The [Air Force and Space Force] missions dont fundamentally change [by then], but both services need to go through a transformation± by 2050, Kendall said. The Air Force will need to procure and maintain the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile and B-21 Raider stealth bomber as the core of its portion of the nations nuclear triad, Kendall said. It must also accelerate its shift to standoff capabilities that can be launched outside an enemys territory, as well as mature survivable stand-in capabilities such as Next Generation Air Dominance, or NGAD, drone wingmen known as collaborative combat aircraft, or CCA, and a next-generation refueling tanker. Kendalls report largely calls for continuing the Space Forces current mission just at a larger scale and with new architectures and tactics. It predicts growth in the number of satellites in orbit and in the size of the force that will operate them. While today, there are 10,000 guardians in the Space Force, he suggested that by 2050, there will be ∞multiples of this number.± China will likely remain the ∞pacing challenge± for the U.S. and its allies, Kendall said. He predicted China will continue to develop militarily and be able to challenge the U.S. and its allies not only in the Indo-Pacific region but worldwide. Russia will also remain hostile and a ∞serious threat,± he said, but its economic weaknesses could hinder its military ambitions. But many ∞wildcards± exist that make it hard to predict 25 years in the future, Kendall said, such as unforeseen technological advances, a potential nuclear exchange between nations or a Chinese attack on Taiwan. And the department needs to make several decisions to prepare for the possibility of a very different future. Options on NGAD One of the most pressing concerns for the Air Force which will ultimately be up to the incoming Trump administration to decide is how to modernize its fighter force to keep control of the skies in a future war. For years, the service has planned to create NGAD as a family of systems with an advanced sixth-generation platform flying alongside CCAs to replace the F-22 Raptor, which was designed three decades ago to specialize in air superiority. The service originally planned to award an NGAD contract in 2024. However, Kendall said Monday the service would have needed more than $20 billion added to its budget for research and development for NGAD. The potential cost of the platform turned out to be prohibitively expensive, about three times that of the F-35, which would have only allowed the Air Force to buy a small fleet of NGAD fighters. Kendall put NGAD on hold while the service reconsidered its options and consulted with multiple airpower experts, but felt it was best to let the next administration make the final decision on how to proceed. The Air Force felt there was ∞value± in going ahead with NGAD, Kendall said but without a budget increase, the service needed to pay for other priorities first. The Air Force and Space Force ""need to go through a transformation"" by 2050, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall, shown here in February 2024, said in his last week leading the department. (Eric Dietrich/U.S. Air Force) There are alternatives to an F-22 replacement like NGAD, Kendall said, such as another aircraft that would be an F-35 successor. That successor could, like the F-35, be a multirole aircraft that would be designed for controlling CCAs, he said and could be ∞much less expensive± than NGAD. Another alternative could be to further boost the Air Forces long-range strike capability, Kendall said. Those capabilities could include long-range cruise missiles. ∞Thats something we could do in any event,± Kendall said. ∞Its relatively inexpensive, and probably makes some sense to do more that way.± Kendall expressed hesitancy toward suggestions from some including Trump adviser Elon Musk that the Air Force should abandon efforts to build another post-F-35 crewed fighter and instead focus on drones. ∞I dont think were quite there yet,± Kendall said. ∞I think that could be considered.± But a shift away from an Air Force with pilots would require a major cultural shift, Kendall said one for which hes not sure the service is ready. ∞The culture and history and the legacy of the Air Force, which I have been steeped in ≠ for my whole life, really, is about the role of the pilot,± Kendall said. ∞Letting go, to some degree, of that, is an incredibly difficult emotional thing for people to do.± Space Force grows up Although Kendalls report doesnt predict major changes to the Space Forces mission, it does call for growth and a sense of urgency in response to aggression in the domain from China and Russia. The document points to a ∞revolution± in space technology over the last decade that has changed the cost equation for accessing and operating in the space environment, and Kendall said he expects that to continue to shape global reliance on the domain over the next 25 years. RELATED Money, Musk and mission creep: How Trump could shape DODs space driftThe path to a larger Space Force budget isnt clear even as Trump, who oversaw the creation of the service, prepares to take office in the coming weeks. By Courtney Albon ∞Were going to need a much bigger, much more capable, much more powerful Space Force,± he said at CSIS. ∞Thats a transformation thats already started, and weve made some pretty good progress on that since just five years again when the Space Force was created and particularly in the last few years as weve moved to acquire and field distributed, resilient architectures.± As part of that growth, Kendall said, the service will need to ∞expand substantially± its inventory of offensive, or counterspace, capabilities to defend against and respond to aggression from China and other adversaries. That could include a range of capabilities, he wrote in the report, from on-orbit kinetic weapons to others based on the ground. The service should also build improved battle damage assessment capabilities to mitigate any debris created by destroying satellites. Another growth area for the service is surveillance and targeting a mission that has traditionally been performed by aircraft. Under Kendalls tenure, the Air Force has taken steps to shift that work to space-based sensors and communication networks. The service will also need to invest in more automation of its space domain awareness systems, which observe, track and catalogue objects in space, Kendall said Monday. ∞Trying to monitor all that and track it without a high degree of automation is impossible,± he said. ∞Weve got to go much more in that direction.± The report predicts that by 2050, common space-based sensors will share data with the Defense Department and intelligence community. Commercial data will also feed into those systems, making it harder for an enemy to decide which parts of the architecture to target. Kendalls report also suggests that long- and short-range missiles will continue to be the ∞preferred weapon,± making the Space Forces missile warning and tracking capabilities increasingly important for the joint force. Those capabilities include space-based sensors that can detect and track ballistic missiles as well as hypersonic weapons, which can travel and maneuver at speeds above Mach 5. ∞The resilient architectures being fielded now will evolve and be updated multiple times between now and 2050,± the report states. ∞Because of their importance to nuclear stability, these systems will be a high priority for reliability and resilience, but they also must be adequately survivable in a conventional conflict.± About Stephen Losey and Courtney Albon Stephen Losey is the air warfare reporter for Defense News.

NATO intercepts of Russian aircraft stable in 2024 over prior year,"PARIS The number of times NATO fighter jet scrambled to intercept Russian military aircraft approaching allied airspace over Europe has changed little in 2024 compared to 2023, even as Western leaders grow increasingly worried about Russian aggression and hybrid warfare targeting European countries within the alliance. NATOs Allied Air Command in Ramstein, Germany, saw ∞no sensitive uptick± in Russian air activity over Europe, an alliance official told Defense News. The number of intercepts ∞remained mostly the same± from the previous year, when NATO air policing missions scrambled well over 300 times to intercept Russian military aircraft approaching allied airspace, mostly over the Baltic Sea. The alliance keeps jets on duty around the clock to scramble in case of suspicious or unannounced flights, and Russias invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 means the air-policing mission established during the Cold War has taken on renewed significance. NATO faces a war on its eastern front that has prompted Russian threats, suspected acts of sabotage in the Baltic, and violations of European Union airspace by drones targeting Ukraine. NATO forces across Europe scrambled more than 400 times in total in 2024, according to Allied Air Command. Most of the time jets are scrambled when aircraft approach European borders without properly identifying themselves or communicating with air traffic control. Allied Air Command declined to provide exact numbers on how many times NATO jets scramble and where, saying the data could reveal sensitive information potentially harmful to the security of the ongoing operation. Scrambles to monitor Russian military aircraft reportedly saw a peak in 2022, nearly doubling from a year earlier to 570 due to the start of the war in Ukraine. The jump came amid increased activity by the Russian military, and a stronger NATO presence on Europes eastern flank meaning more fighter jets available for air surveillance, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, citing DPA. European NATO members have beefed up their presence in the Baltic countries and on Europes Eastern front in response to Russias aggression. European air forces contribute a range of aircraft for air policing, including Dutch and Norwegian F-35s, Belgian F-16s, Italian and British Eurofighters, Spanish F/A-18s and French Rafales. Estonia in November completed major runway renovation works at ?mari Air Base in order to better support the air-policing mission in the Baltics, with the Dutch the first to start operating NATO jets from the renovated base in December. The alliance in June held its first one-on-one dogfighting event at Ramstein Air Base since 1994 Russian military aircraft along NATOs eastern flank have a history of not transmitting a transponder code indicating their position and altitude, not filing a flight plan or not communicating with air traffic controllers, according to Allied Air Command. Most aerial encounters between NATO and Russian jets are safe and professional, and breaches of NATO airspace by Russian military aircraft are generally rare and of short duration, according to the command.

Russian air defenses may have downed Azerbaijani plane: U.S. official,"Russian air defense systems may have brought down an Azerbaijani airliner this week, a U.S. official said Friday after an Azerbaijani minister also suggested the plane was hit by a weapon, citing expert analysis and survivor accounts. Fridays assessments by Rashad Nabiyev and White House national security spokesman John Kirby echoed those made by outside aviation experts who blamed the crash on Russian air defense systems responding to a Ukrainian attack. These statements raised pressure on Russia, where officials said a drone attack was underway in the region where the Azerbaijan Airlines flight was heading for a landing. They did not address statements blaming air defenses. Kirby told reporters on Friday that the U.S. ∞[has] seen some early indications that would certainly point to the possibility that this jet was brought down by Russian air defense systems,± but refused to elaborate, citing an ongoing investigation. Pressed on whether the U.S. has intelligence that helped lead to that conclusion, or was simply relying on informed speculation from experts based on visual assessments of the crash, Kirby characterized the short answer as ∞yes± but said hed ∞leave it at that,± without providing further details. The plane was flying from Azerbaijans capital of Baku to Grozny, the regional capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, on Wednesday when it turned toward Kazakhstan and crashed while making an attempt to land. The crash killed 38 people and left all 29 survivors injured. Nabiyev, Azerbaijans minister of digital development and transportation, told Azerbaijani media that ∞preliminary conclusions by experts point at external impact,± as does witness testimony. ∞The type of weapon used in the impact will be determined during the probe,± Nabiyev said. Passengers and crew who survived the crash told Azerbaijani media that they heard loud noises on the aircraft as it was circling over Grozny. Flight attendant Aydan Rahimli said that after one noise, the oxygen masks automatically released. She said that she went to perform first aid on a colleague, Zulfugar Asadov, and then they heard another bang. Asadov said that the noises sounded like something hitting the plane from outside. Shortly afterward, he sustained a sudden injury like a ∞deep wound, the arm was lacerated as if someone hit me in the arm with an ax,± he added. He denied a claim from Kazakh officials that an oxygen canister exploded inside the plane. Two other survivors recounted hearing explosions before the plane went down. Jerova Salihat told Azerbaijani television in an interview in the hospital that ∞something exploded± near her leg, and Vafa Shabanova said that ∞there were two explosions in the sky, and an hour and a half later the plane crashed to the ground.± Dmitry Yadrov, head of Russias civil aviation authority Rosaviatsia, said Friday that as the plane was preparing to land in Grozny in deep fog, Ukrainian drones were targeting the city, prompting authorities to close the area to air traffic. Yadrov said that after the captain made two unsuccessful attempts to land, he was offered other airports but decided to fly to Aktau in Kazakhstan, across the Caspian Sea. He didnt comment on statements from some aviation experts, who pointed out that holes seen in the planes tail section suggested that it could have come under fire from Russian air defense systems. Ukrainian drones have previously attacked Grozny and other areas in the Russian North Caucasus. Azerbaijan Airlines blamed the crash on unspecified ∞physical and technical interference± and announced the suspension of flights to several Russian airports. It didnt say where the interference came from or provide any further details. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on the claims that the plane was hit by Russian air defenses, saying that it will be up to investigators to determine the cause of the crash. ∞The air incident is being investigated, and we dont believe we have the right to make any assessments until the conclusions are made as a result of the investigation,± Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. If its proven that the plane crashed after being hit by Russian air defenses, it would be the second deadly civil aviation accident linked to fighting in Ukraine. Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was downed with a Russian surface-to-air missile, killing all 298 people aboard, as it flew over the area in eastern Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed separatists in 2014. Russia has denied responsibility, but a Dutch court in 2022 convicted two Russians and a pro-Russia Ukrainian man for their role in downing the plane with an air defense system brought into Ukraine from a Russian military base. Investigators from Azerbaijan are working in Grozny as part of the probe of Wednesdays crash, the Azerbaijani Prosecutor Generals office said in a statement. Following Wednesdays suspension of flights from Baku to Grozy and Makhachkala, Azerbaijan Airlines announced Friday that it would also halt service to eight more Russian cities. The company will continue to operate flights to six Russian cities, including Moscow and St. Petersburg. Those cities also have been repeatedly targeted by Ukrainian drone strikes in the past. Kazakhstans Qazaq Air also announced Friday that it was suspending flights from Astana to the Russian city of Yekaterinburg in the Ural Mountains for a month. FlyDubai also halted flights to Sochi and Mineralnye Vody in southern Russia for the next few days. The day before, Israels El Al carrier suspended flights from Tel Aviv to Moscow citing ∞developments in Russias airspace.± The airline said it would reassess the situation next week.

This Army unit is the first to field new company and battalion drones,"Soldiers with the 10th Mountain Division, which is currently deployed in Romania, recently became the first Army unit to field the services newest reconnaissance drones. The 317th Brigade Engineer Battalion, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, out of Fort Johnson, Louisiana, employed the Skydio and GhostX systems during training operations at Mihail Kogalniceanu Air Base, Romania, according to an Army release. The new drones fit different mission profiles at the tactical level. The Skydio X10D drone is a short-range recon aircraft that can fly up to 5 kilometers and stay aloft for approximately 30 minutes, according to the release. Typically, the Skydio is deployed by infantry and scout platoons on dismounted patrols, providing soldiers with a better snapshot of their immediate area during mission planning. The GhostX, made by Anduril, goes a bit farther. It can fly up to 15 kilometers and stay in the air for an hour. This platform is geared toward a company commanders needs in a larger area of operation.

During the late November training, the unit qualified 132 Skydio operators, according to the release. ∞They can take the [Sydio] aircraft out of its case, assemble it, mission plan and get it in the air in less than 10 minutes,± Sweeny said. Every company in the 3rd BCT is slated to receive a Skydio system, with next steps expected to include using the systems in training at the Joint Multinational Readiness Center in Hoehenfels, Germany.

"Under Trump, decision on Air Forces NGAD will shape fleet for decades","The Air Force will set a new path for how it will fight air wars during the first year of the next Donald Trump presidency, which will have ramifications for decades to come. The Air Force struggled for much of 2024 to figure out how and even whether to proceed with its planned sixth-generation fighter, known as Next Generation Air Dominance, or NGAD. But NGADs original anticipated cost which came in at about three times as much as an F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, or in the neighborhood of $250 million to $300 million derailed the Air Forces plans to proceed. This summer, the service put the programs planned contract award on hold and launched a review of NGAD, and its air superiority strategy as a whole, to find out if there is a way to achieve its goals more affordably. The Air Force originally intended to make a decision on NGAD by the end of 2024. But in December, after President-elect Trumps victory, the service announced it would defer that choice to the new administration. The service sees the advanced fighter, which would replace the F-22 Raptor, as a critical part of the Air Forces ability to fight a future war against China in the Indo-Pacific region. It would be part of a family of systems, including autonomously driven drone wingmen known as collaborative combat aircraft, and be powered by an advanced adaptive engine that could shift to the ideal configuration for its current flight conditions. The technologies and capabilities both competitors for NGAD widely expected to be Boeing and Lockheed Martin are proposing are ∞incredible,± Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Dave Allvin said Dec. 7. But before the service commits itself to a course, he said, it has to make sure its moving in the right direction. ∞Were about to go through a one-way door,± Allvin said at the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, California. ∞Before you go through that one-way door, we thought it prudent that we look at the arc of the threat, how this [NGAD] platform integrates with the rest of the capabilities of the Air Force, and whether that integrated set of capabilities was going to meet the threat and be able to exceed the threat.± Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Va., chairman of the House Armed Services subcommittee on tactical air and land forces, said the Air Force is right to ask those ∞tough questions± before it moves too far along on NGAD, and to give the incoming administration its chance to chart a path forward. That will help avoid creating an NGAD platform that isnt properly set up to tackle the threats it will face in years to come, he said. ∞Whats happened in the past is, we make decisions [on platforms], and the operationalization of that capability sometimes doesnt occur for years,± Wittman said. ∞By the time it gets operationalized, the threats changed.± The Air Force is also putting thought into how NGADs platform would work with CCAs and a future tanker called NGAS, or next-generation aerial refueling system, Wittman said. Since the election, prominent Trump advisers Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have disparaged the idea of building more crewed fighters, and said the military should instead concentrate on drones. Crewed fighters will be necessary for the military in the near-term, Wittman said. But in the long term, he said, uncrewed platforms will take on a greater role particularly as technology advances at a rapid pace. ∞The question will always be, how does that transition take place?± Wittman said. ∞We are not going to go from a fleet of F-35s, B-21s, B-52s [and] F-15EXs to tomorrow, everything unmanned. ≠ [Going] completely from crewed to uncrewed, I think, is still years in the future. But the learning curve is going to be, how do we incorporate uncrewed aircraft.± Allvin agreed drones will play a key role in future warfare, and he feels the military needs to strike a balance between crewed and uncrewed platforms such as CCAs. ∞The future is really about the most effective human-machine teaming,± Allvin said. ∞One can take the idea of drones or uncrewed warfare ≠ to the extreme, and if you take the human out of this very human endeavor, which is warfare, then it becomes too easy to do. Warfare is always a human endeavor.± Noah Robertson contributed to this report. About Stephen Losey Stephen Losey is the air warfare reporter for Defense News.

"Air Force secretary: Elon Musk Ænot a warfighter, needs to learn more","Outgoing Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall on Thursday downplayed Elon Musks recent pronouncements that crewed fighters are obsolete in the era of drones, and suggested the billionaire industrialist learn more about the military. ∞I have a lot of respect for Elon Musk as an engineer,± Kendall said during a webcast with the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies. ∞Hes not a warfighter, and he needs to learn a little bit more about the business, I think, before he makes such grand announcements as he did.± In November, Musk wrote that ∞manned fighter jets are obsolete in the age of drones± and called those building jets like the F-35 ∞idiots± in a series of posts on his social media platform X. SpaceX founder and billionaire Musk allied himself with President-elect Donald Trump this year, and has become a key confidant to the incoming president with growing influence. Trump named Musk, along with entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, to run a task force dubbed Department of Government Efficiency to examine ways to slash federal spending. Musk made multiple scathing posts Wednesday about a proposed continuing resolution bill funding the government for three months that Congress was set to vote on, and his stance was soon echoed by Trump. This prompted Republican lawmakers to reject the CR, throwing the funding process into uncertainty and raising the specter of a government shutdown over Christmas. Musks dig at crewed fighter jets isnt the first time hes ruffled Air Force feathers over the topic. In 2020, he appeared at an Air Force Association conference and declared, ∞The fighter jet era has passed.± But while Musks star may be rising in the new Trump administration, Kendall said Musks idea of a drone Air Force that can take the place of the current crewed fleet is still years away from having the necessary technology to work. ∞Its provocative, its interesting,± Kendall said. ∞I can imagine at some point I dont think its centuries, by the way, I think its more like decades when something like he imagines can occur. But were not there, and its going to be a little while before we get there.± The Air Force is rapidly moving toward adopting autonomous drone wingmen known as collaborative combat aircraft, or CCAs, which would pair with F-35A fighters and, possibly, the services future Next Generation Air Dominance fighter. Kendall said CCAs show the growing importance uncrewed platforms are playing in the Air Forces arsenal but that crewed fighters cant be abandoned yet. When the Air Force flies CCAs into battle, he said, it will be important to have a human battle manager nearby to control them as a unit, with a highly secure communications feed. Pilots in simulators are already starting to learn how to manage large numbers of CCAs while continuing to operate their own jet, Kendall said and are enthusiastic about the new possibilities and new ways to safely accomplish their missions CCAs will provide. ∞My vision ≠ is that our operators are going to embrace this, theyre going to move it forward and theyre going to deploy it in a cost-effective way,± Kendall said. ∞I was a little unsure as to how our operators would react to this, but when I asked them the question, ÆHow do you feel about this, they say, ÆSir, these are going to keep us alive.± Kendall said the military should continue to buy the F-35, which he called a ∞state-of-the-art system thats continuously being upgraded,± and in high demand from allied militaries around the world. The Air Force plans to buy 1,763 F-35s, but Kendall said the final number could change depending on how well CCAs and NGAD work out.

"No runways, no sorties: Chinese missiles threaten US airpower plans","American air bases ∞can no longer be considered a sanctuary.± That is the sobering conclusion of the U.S. Air Forces new Installation Infrastructure Action Plan, released in December. Unlike the last 30 years, when U.S air bases were largely safe havens from enemy attacks, the document continues, ∞adversaries now possess high-end capabilities± that can threaten such installations. This warning is correct, but it understates the threat. In our new Stimson Center report, ∞Cratering Effects: Chinese Missile Threats to US Air Bases in the Indo-Pacific,± and co-authored with Jonathan Walker, we conclude that Chinese missile strikes could keep U.S. military runways and taxiways in Japan, Guam, and other Pacific islands closed in the critical first days and even weeks of a war between the United States and China. Even if the United States undertook massive investments in a mix of active and passive countermeasures, runways and taxiways would remain closed for at least the first several days of any conflict. Specifically, the United States would not be able to operate fighter aircraft from U.S. air bases in Japan for close to the first two weeks of a conflict, including from Kadena Air Base and Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, located closest to the Taiwan Strait. These are the only two locations from which U.S. fifth-generation fighters would be able to complete their missions and return to base without requiring aerial refueling. Most importantly, Chinese missiles could keep U.S. military runways in Japan closed to aerial refueling tankers and the aircraft which depend on them for in-flight fuel for over a month. Chinas growing reach could also keep U.S. air bases in Guam and other Pacific locations closed to tankers and bombers for at least the first four days of a conflict, and thereafter the United States would face other significant operational problems. For example, low-flying and slow-moving tankers are already vulnerable to Chinese air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, but they would be especially easy for China to detect and shoot down when flying predictable flight routes from Guam and a handful of other Pacific bases. Unfortunately, no single countermeasure or even a combination of countermeasures will be sufficient to counter runway attacks by the Peoples Liberation Army Rocket Force. Our results validate the Air Forces Agile Combat Employment concept of dispersing U.S. aircraft and personnel more widely across multiple locations. If the United States were to disperse to civilian airfields in the Pacific, as well as Japan Self Defense Force bases and civilian airfields in Japan, assuming it had the necessary political permissions, the shortest closure time would decline by over 70% in Japan, or three days for fighter operations and nine days for tanker operations. Within the Second Island Chain, closure times would drop only by about 10%, with runways opening on the fourth day. These results, however, assume all personnel, equipment, and repair materials are available and ready for use at these other operating locations, which is not the case. Even if Washington and Tokyo made these substantial investments, Chinese missiles would still keep aircraft grounded in the critical first days of a war, when the U.S. Air Force might be expected to quickly set up a combat air patrol or sink Chinese ships in the Taiwan Strait. Recently, senior Air Force leaders have emphasized the need to protect U.S. air bases in the Indo-Pacific with more robust missile defense capabilities, with Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall going so far as to suggest his service should take over this mission from the Army. Our findings suggest that even a massive buildup of U.S. missile defense capabilities is likely to fall short, however, even when combined with other countermeasures. For example, even if the United States grew its Patriot missile defense force expanding to 20 Patriot batteries and deployed them all to protect runways in Japan China could still deny the use of these runways by fighters in the first two days of a war, and thereafter fighters would have to operate without any tanker support for another week. Without tankers, these fighters would have to fly fewer sorties each day. The operational gains hardly seem to justify the costs, especially because China could easily offset these investments by increasing its missile stocks. Instead, the United States will need to outthink not outspend China. Doing so requires the Air Force to prioritize the air denial mission within the First Island Chain, including building an inside air force around large numbers of runway-independent platforms and drones of various types and different ranges. Over time, as the Chinese missile threat dissipates, the United States could bring forward more traditional crewed aircraft, including advanced fighters and the tankers required to support them, and transition to air superiority and offensive strike missions. To make that happen, however, the Air Force will need to move more rapidly toward uncrewed and autonomous systems, preposition equipment and munition stockpiles, and prepare to prioritize air denial in the initial air war.

Kurdish forces in Syria accidentally shot down US Reaper drone,"Kurdish-led forces in Syria, allied with the United States, shot down an Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone on Monday after mistakenly identifying it as a threat. Troops from the Syrian Democratic Forces, a key ally for the United States in its fight against the Islamic State, were conducting operations in the region when they downed the MQ-9, a U.S. official familiar with the situation confirmed to Defense News. RELATED How the US is countering ISIS during Syrias upheavalThe U.S. and its partners want to ensure the Islamic State cant fill the leadership void following President Bashar Assads overthrow, officials said. By Lolita C. Baldor, The Associated Press The MQ-9 was operating over Syria to support the campaign against the remnants of the Islamic State, known as Operation Inherent Resolve. U.S. forces recovered the parts of the drone that needed to be salvaged and destroyed the rest, the official said. ∞U.S. Air Forces Central [Command] is actively assessing the actions that led to the incident and will adjust tactics, techniques and procedures to safeguard U.S., coalition, and partner forces and their associated assets,± the official said. The SDFs position in Syria has grown precarious in the days since the ouster of President Bashar Assad. Turkey, which borders Syria to the north, has accused the SDF of having ties to the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which Turkey views as a terrorist group. The Telegraph reported the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army began advancing toward the Syrian Kurdish-controlled city of Manbij earlier this week, before the U.S. helped broker a ceasefire between the SNA and SDF. U.S. forces, including B-52 Stratofortress bombers, A-10 Warthog attack planes and F-15 fighters, pounded 75 ISIS targets in dozens of strikes shortly after the rapid fall of the Assad regime.
